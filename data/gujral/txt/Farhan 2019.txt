{"Abstract": ["OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of pre-diabetes (pre-DM) on coronary plaque characteristics and ischemic outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). BACKGROUND Pre-DM (i.e., the early stages of glucometabolic disturbance) is common among patients with ACS, but the extent to which pre-DM influences coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for adverse ischemic events is unclear. METHODS In the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in Coronary Tree) study, patients with ACS underwent quantitative coronary angiography, grayscale intravascular ultrasound, and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their glucometabolic status, as defined by the American Diabetes Association: normal glucose metabolism (NGM), pre-DM, and diabetes mellitus (DM). These groups were compared with regard to coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (defined as cardiac death or arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina). RESULTS Among 547 patients, 162 (29.6%) had NGM, 202 (36.9%) had pre-DM, and 183 (33.4%) had DM. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to intravascular ultrasound findings indicative of vulnerable plaques. Patients with DM had a higher crude rate of MACEs than those with pre-DM or NGM (25.9% vs. 16.3% and 16.1%; p \u00bc 0.03 and p \u00bc 0.02, respectively). In an adjusted Cox regression model using NGM as the reference group, DM (hazard ratio: 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 3.86; p \u00bc 0.006) but not pre-DM (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 2.33; p \u00bc 0.41) was associated with increased risk for MACEs.CONCLUSIONS Impaired glucose metabolism is common among patients presenting with ACS. DM but not pre-DM is associated with an increased risk for MACEs. Thus, preventing patients from progressing from pre-DM to DM is important.

The study design and main results have been published elsewhere (7). In brief, 697 patients with ACS who were treated successfully with PCI for all lesions deemed responsible for the index event were enrolled. All included patients underwent angiography as well as grayscale and intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) (Volcano Corporation, San Diego, California) of the left main coronary artery as well as 6 to 8 cm of the proximal portion of each major epicardial coronary vessel.", "In the present analysis, patients were divided according to their glucometabolic status into those with normal glucose metabolism (NGM), pre-DM, and DM on the basis of recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (8). DM was defined as a history of DM or ongoing treatment with glucoselowering medication or dietary control and/or fasting glucose $126 mg/dl and/or glycated hemoglobin $6.5%. Pre-DM was defined as fasting glucose $100 and <126 mg/dl and/or glycated hemoglobin $5.7% in patients who did not meet any of the criteria for DM.", "NGM was defined as fasting glucose <100 mg/dl and/or glycated hemoglobin <5.7% and the absence of all criteria for DM. All laboratory measurements were performed while fasting during the hospitalization for the index procedure (9).", "GRAYSCALE IVUS AND IVUS-VH. Grayscale IVUS and IVUS-VH analyses were performed using QCU-CMS (Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, the Netherlands). pcVH 2.1 (Volcano Corporation) was used for contouring and data output, and proprietary software (qVH, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York) was used for segmental quantitative and qualitative analyses (10,11). The external elastic membrane (EEM) and lumen borders were detected at approximately every 0.4-mm interval (depending on heart rate) and used to determine the EEM cross-sectional area (CSA), lumen CSA, and plaque plus media CSA and burden (defined as 100 \u00c2 [plaque \u00fe media]/EEM CSA). A nonculprit lesion was defined as $3 consecutive frames with plaque burden $40%. IVUS-VH allows the characterization of 4 different plaque components (red corresponds to necrotic core, green to fibrous tissue, light green to fibrofatty, and white to dense calcium). On the basis of its compositional traits, each lesion was classified as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), thick-cap fibroatheroma, pathological intimal thickening, fibrotic plaque, or fibrocalcific plaque (11,12). All IVUS frames were coregistered to the angiographic roadmap using fiduciary side branches for alignment.", "CLINICAL ENDPOINTS.

This is concerning, because the prevalence of DM continues to increase and currently constitutes a growing threat to public health (13). The high prevalence of impaired glucose metabolism in  1.", "J A C C : C A R D I O V A S C U L A R I M A G I N G , V O L . 1 2 , N O . 4 , 2 0 1 9", "Farhan et al.", "A P R I L 2 0 1 9 : 7 3 3 -4 1", "Impaired Glucose Tolerance in ACS our study is consistent with previous work showing that pre-DM and DM are prevalent among patients with CAD, particularly among those with ACS (2,3).", "In the present study the risk for MACEs was approximately double for patients with versus without DM, a finding that is consistent with previous studies showing that the risk for adverse events after PCI is approximately double for patients with DM versus without DM (14). In contrast, the risk for patients with pre-DM was similar to that of patients with NGM. This may seem surprising, but it is consistent Thus, compared with patients with DM in other studies, patients with DM in PROSEPCT likely had less severe and less long-standing hyperglycemia at the time of coronary assessment (9). We prospectively  studied nonculprit lesions after successful PCI, whereas the other studies focused on culprit lesions. It is possible that the association between DM and highrisk plaque characteristics that has been described for culprit lesions is less pronounced in nonculprit lesions (25,26). Notably, only the proximal 6 to 8 cm of each major epicardial coronary artery was evaluated in the PROSPECT study (7). Necropsy studies have shown that DM affects predominantly distal portions of coronary arteries (27), which could explain the apparent lack of differences in high-risk plaque features.", "Microvascular dysfunction, which is prevalent among patients with DM, may have contributed to the increased risk for MACE among patients with DM (28).", "Last, the diagnostic criteria used to detect pre-DM and latent DM were different in our study than in the other studies (29). It is possible that stratification of patients into NGM, pre-DM, and DM groups, as per the ADA guidelines, is not the most efficient means of predicting the presence of high-risk plaque characteristics. In fact, a previous publication from PROSPECT that focused on established DM and metabolic syndrome rather than pre-DM showed that patients with neither DM nor metabolic syndrome had the most favorable plaque characteristics, although these differences were small in magnitude (30). The differences between the present analysis and that of Marso et al. Given the fact that most patients in the DM group had non-insulin-dependent DM, our findings are consistent with previous observations that primary preventive measures appear to be more effective in patients with non-insulin-dependent versus insulindependent DM (31). Thus, even among patients who have progressed to non-insulin-treated DM, appropriate glucometabolic control and other therapeutic measures may prevent progression of CAD (32,33). This hypothesis should be tested in clinical trials specifically designed for patients with pre-DM or newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent DM.", "STUDY LIMITATIONS. This study had several limitations. First, this was a post hoc analysis of a prospective study, and our results should be considered hypothesis generating rather than confirmatory.", "Second, plasma glucose concentrations may be increased in ACS, which increases the risk of inadvertently classifying patients with NGM as having pre-DM or DM (34); however, the GAMI (Glucose Tolerance in Acute Myocardial Infarction) study, which enrolled patients with acute myocardial infarction, showed that results were similar when glucose tolerance was estimated during the index hospitalization or 3 months later (35).

In fact, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of DM duration(16,17) and cumulative hyperglycemic insults(18,19) among patients with long-standing DM on the risk for adverse ischemic events. Hence, pre-DM may represent a stage at which few of the end-organ effects of hyperglycemia, including effects on the coronary arterial tree, have occurred. Our findings support this hypothesis.That being said, whether early stages of glucometabolic impairment affect coronary plaque morphology is still a matter of debate. Hyperglycemia and resistance promote the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and angiotensin). This leads to a proinflammatory state with accelerated atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction (20-22). Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia and daily glucose fluctuations have been associated with coronary plaque vulnerability (22,23). Amano et al. (5) investigated coronary culprit lesions of patients with CAD and found higher plaque volume and lipid content in patients with DM as well as in those with early stages of glucose abnormalities. Similarly, Kurihara et al. (6) showed a higher degree of yellow vulnerable plaque in patients with pre-DM and DM using coronary angioscopy. It may therefore seem surprising that we found no differences in the prevalence of high-risk plaque characteristics between any of the study groups. The reason for the discrepant findings between our investigation and previous studies could be explained by the difference in study design and the investigated population. Only a minority of the patients in PROSPECT had insulintreated DM, and patients with insulin-treated DM have been shown to have considerably more extensive CAD than patients with non-insulin-treated DM (24).", "Overall major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), (B) culprit lesion MACEs, and (C) nonculprit lesion MACEs stratified by glucometabolic status.

Background: Pre-DM (i.e., the early stages of glucometabolic disturbance) is common among patients with ACS, but the extent to which pre-DM influences coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for adverse ischemic events is unclear. Methods: In the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in Coronary Tree) study, patients with ACS underwent quantitative coronary angiography, grayscale intravascular ultrasound, and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their glucometabolic status, as defined by the American Diabetes Association: normal glucose metabolism (NGM), pre-DM, and diabetes mellitus (DM). These groups were compared with regard to coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (defined as cardiac death or arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina). Results: Among 547 patients, 162 (29.6%) had NGM, 202 (36.9%) had pre-DM, and 183 (33.4%) had DM. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to intravascular ultrasound findings indicative of vulnerable plaques. Patients with DM had a higher crude rate of MACEs than those with pre-DM or NGM (25.9% vs. 16.3% and 16.1%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). In an adjusted Cox regression model using NGM as the reference group, DM (hazard ratio: 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 3.86; p = 0.006) but not pre-DM (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 2.33; p = 0.41) was associated with increased risk for MACEs. Conclusions: Impaired glucose metabolism is common among patients presenting with ACS. DM but not pre-DM is associated with an increased risk for MACEs. Thus, preventing patients from progressing from pre-DM to DM is important. (PROSPECT: An Imaging Study in Patients With Unstable Atherosclerotic Lesions; NCT00180466)."]}
