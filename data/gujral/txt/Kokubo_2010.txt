{"Abstract": ["Few prospective studies have examined the combined impact of blood pressure (BP) categories and glucose abnormalities on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general Asian population. This study aimed to examine the effect of the combined risks of these factors on the incidence of CVD in a general Japanese population. We studied 5321 Japanese individuals (aged 30-79 years), without CVD at baseline, who received follow-up for an average of 11.7 years. Serum fasting glucose categories were defined according to the 2003 American Diabetes Association recommendations. BP categories were defined by the 2009 Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension. The Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD according to the serum glucose and BP categories were calculated. In 62 036 person-years of follow-up, we documented 364 CVD events (198 stroke and 166 coronary heart disease (CHD)). Compared with normoglycemic subjects, the multivariable HRs (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for CVD, CHD and stroke were 1.25 (1.00-1.58), 1.46 (1.04-2.04) and 1.11 (0.81-1.52), respectively, in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), whereas these values were 2. 13 (1.50-3.03), 2.28 (1.34-3.88) and 2.08 (1.29-3.35), respectively, in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM). Compared with normoglycemic and optimal blood pressure (BP) subjects, increased risks of CVD were observed in the normoglycemic subjects with high-normal BP or hypertension, the IFG subjects with normal or higher BP, and the DM subjects regardless of BP category (P-value for interaction\u00bc0.046). In conclusion, the high-normal BP subjects in all glucose categories and the normal BP subjects with IFG showed increased risk of CVD in this Japanese population. Further investigation of larger cohorts of DM subjects should be conducted to better understand this phenomenon."], "INTRODUCTION": ["Hypertension is one of the strongest risk factors for increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide. [1][2][3] Recently, high-normal blood pressure (BP) 1,2 and prehypertension 3 have also been recognized as risk factors for CVD. [4][5][6] Increased BP is the most likely precipitator of CVD and stroke. 5,7,8 Furthermore, the prevalence of glucose intolerance and obesity has increased greatly in recent years. 9,10 Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a major public health problem 11,12 as well as a risk factor for all-cause mortality 11 and CVD. 10,[13][14][15] Recently, prediabetic hyperglycemia has been recognized to confer an increased risk for CVD. 16 However, a few population studies 17 have reported a positive association between CVD and impaired fasting glucose (defined as blood glucose of 5.6-6.9 mmol l \u00c01 according to the 2003 American Diabetes Association definition). 18 Evaluation of the combined impact of these two major borderline risk factors is essential in preventing CVD because elevated BP is the highest population attributable fraction (PAF) of CVD incidence, and the incidence of hyperglycemia is increasing in Asian and Western countries. There have been a few population studies on the association between the occurrence of hypertension together with DM and the risk of stroke [19][20][21] and coronary heart disease (CHD). 22 However, few population cohort studies have evaluated the impact of the combination of BP categories (optimal BP, normal BP, high-normal BP (or prehypertension) and hypertension) and fasting glucose categories (normoglycemia, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and DM) on the risk of CVD. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the combined impact of BP categories and blood glucose abnormalities on the incidence of CVD in a general urban Japanese population."], "METHODS": [], "Study subjects": ["The Suita Study, a cohort study for CVD in urban residents, was established in 1989. The details of this study have been described elsewhere. 5,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29] Briefly, 6485 individuals (aged 30 to 79 years) underwent regular health checkups between September 1989 and March 1994. Some cohort members were excluded for the following reasons: past or present history of CVD at baseline (n\u00bc208); missing data (n\u00bc170); nonfasting blood collections (n\u00bc173); or lost from follow-up (n\u00bc613). After applying these exclusions, a total of 5321 subjects (aged 30 to 79 years) participated in the baseline examination.", "Informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the National Cardiovascular Center."], "Measurement of BP and fasting glucose": ["Measurement of BP has been described elsewhere. 5 In brief, well-trained physicians measured the BP of each individual three times in a seated position using a mercury column sphygmomanometer, an appropriately sized cuff and a standard protocol. Before the initial BP reading was obtained, participants were seated at rest for at least 5 min. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were recorded as the average of the second and third measurements, which were taken more than 1 min apart.", "At the time of the baseline examination, subjects were classified into one of the following BP categories based on the 2009 Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension: 2 optimal BP (SBP, o120 mm Hg and DBP, o80 mm Hg); normal BP (SBP, 120 to 129 mm Hg and DBP, 80 to 84 mm Hg); high-normal BP (SBP, 130 to 139 mm Hg and DBP, 85 to 89 mm Hg); and hypertension (SBP, X140 mm Hg or DBP, X90 mm Hg or antihypertensive drug use). If the SBP and DBP readings for a subject were in different categories, then the subject was categorized into the higher of the two categories.", "We performed routine fasting blood collection and immediately measured serum glucose and total cholesterol levels using the same autoanalyzer (Toshiba TBA-80, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Fasting serum glucose categories were defined as follows: 18 DM (fasting serum glucose X7.0 mmol l \u00c01 (126 mg per 100 ml) or medications for DM); IFG (fasting serum glucose levels 5.6 to 6.9 mmol l \u00c01 (100 to 125 mg per 100 ml)); and normoglycemia (fasting serum glucose levels o5.6 mmol l \u00c01 (o100 mg per 100 ml)). Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total serum cholesterol levels X5.7 mmol l \u00c01 (220 mg per 100 ml) or current use of antihyperlipidemic medications. Physicians or nurses administered questionnaires addressing personal habits and present illness at the baseline examination. Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared."], "Confirmation of stroke and coronary heart disease and end point determination": ["Medical records were reviewed by registered hospital physicians or research physicians who were blinded to the baseline data. Strokes were defined according to the US National Survey of Stroke criteria. 30 For each stroke subtype (that is, cerebral infarction (thrombotic or embolic infarction), intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage), a definite diagnosis was established based on examination of computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance images or autopsies. Definite and probable myocardial infarctions were defined according to the criteria set out by the MONICA project. 31 The criteria for a diagnosis of CHD included first ever acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death within 24 h after the onset of acute illness or coronary artery disease followed by coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty. In this study, CVD was defined as stroke or CHD.", "To detect CHD and stroke occurrences, each participant's health status was checked during clinical visits to the National Cardiovascular Center every 2 years. Yearly questionnaires by mail or telephone were also completed by all participants. In addition, to complete our surveillance for fatal strokes and CHD, we conducted a systematic search for death certificates. All data were checked against medical records to confirm the incidence of CVD. When informed consent could not be obtained for a medical records survey (19.5%), we identified possible strokes or CHD using information from (1) questionnaires for present illness of stroke and CHD at the health examination and/or (2) death certificates bearing a diagnosis of probable stroke or CHD. The end point of the follow-up period for each participant was, whichever of the following options occurred first: (1)  "], "Statistical analysis": ["Analyses of variance and w 2 -tests were used to compare mean values and frequencies. The Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were fitted to each glucose category (normoglycemia, IFG and DM) after adjusting for sex and age in 5-year increments as stratified variables and other potential confounding factors at baseline, including BP category (optimal, normal, and high-normal BP and hypertension), hypercholesterolemia (positive or negative), body mass index (continuous variable), smoking status (never, ex-smoker and current smoker) and drinking status (never, ex-drinker and current drinker). Test for effect modification by glucose category was conducted with an interaction term generated by multiplying BP category by glucose category. We conducted tests for trend across the BP categories and tested the significance of this variable.", "To express the combined impact of glucose and BP categories on the incidence of CVD in these participants, we estimated the PAF as follows:", "PAF \u00bc Pe\u00c2\u00f0HR \u00c0 1\u00de=HR;", "where Pe is the proportion of incident cases in the combination of glucose and BP categories, and HR is the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio. 32 All statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical software package (release version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)."], "RESULTS": ["The frequencies of IFG and DM increased with age in both men and women (Figure 1). Table 1 shows the distribution of CVD risk factors at baseline according to fasting glucose categories at baseline. Both men and women with DM were older and had a higher body mass index as well as a higher prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and medication for hypertension than those without DM. Men with DM had a lower frequency of never drinking than men without DM.", "In 62 036 person-years of follow-up (an average of 11.7 years of follow-up), we documented 364 CVD (198 strokes and 166 CHD) events. Table 2 shows the age-and sex-adjusted HRs and multivariable-adjusted HRs for incidence of CVD according to glucose categories in men and women. Compared with normoglycemic subjects, the multivariable HRs (95% CIs) for CVD, CHD and stroke were 1.25 (1.00-1.58), 1.46 (1.04-2.04) and 1.11 (0.81-1.52), respectively in IFG subjects, whereas these values were 2.13 (1.50-3.03), 2.28 (1.34-3.88) and 2.08 (1.29-3.35), respectively in DM subjects. Compared with normoglycemic subjects, IFG and DM were risk factors for CVD and CHD in women, and DM was a risk factor for CVD and stroke in men.", "Figure 2 shows the multivariable HRs of CVD for the combined impact of the fasting glucose and BP categories. Compared with normoglycemic subjects with optimal BP, the following groups showed increased risk of CVD: the normoglycemic subjects with high-normal BP or hypertension (P-value for trend of BP cate-goryo0.001); the IFG subjects with normal or higher BP (P-value for trend of BP category\u00bc0.001); and the DM subjects in any BP category (P-value for trend of BP category\u00bc0.41). After excluding subjects taking diabetic medication, the P-value for the BP category trend was not statistically significant in the DM subjects.", "The significant interaction terms fasting blood glucose and BP categories were observed in CVD (P\u00bc0.046); however, the interaction term was not significant after exclusion of DM subjects.", "Using the HRs, we estimated the PAF for CVD to exposure to the combined of fasting glucose and BP categories at baseline (Figure The population-attributable risk percentage for CVD incidence was estimated at 3.7% for subjects with normoglycemia and high-normal BP, 5.7% for subjects with IFG and normal or high-normal BP group and 8.2% for subjects with DM and any BP category group, when comparing these groups with the normoglycemic and optimal BP group."], "DISCUSSION": ["In this population cohort study, we found that DM was a risk factor for CVD, stroke and CHD, whereas IFG of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol l \u00c01 was a risk factor for CVD and CHD only. A combined effect of IFG and prehypertension on the incidence of CVD was observed. The high-normal BP subjects in any glucose category and the normal BP subjects with IFG in the Japanese population showed increased risks of CVD. To our knowledge, this study is the first on the combined impact of these borderline risk factors, IFG and prehypertension on the incidence of CVD in a general Asian population.", "Previous cohort studies have shown that DM is a risk factor for CVD, stroke 14,15 and CHD. 13 The results of our study are also essentially compatible with the previous cohort studies in Japan. The Hisayama Study demonstrated that glucose intolerance for 2421 participants was a risk factor for increased incidence of stroke and CHD. 15 Iso et al. 20 reported that glucose abnormalities were a risk factor for ischemic stroke in a Japanese population by using nonfasting glucose levels. The NIPPON DATA 80 Study indicated that DM, defined by nonfasting blood glucose levels, was a risk factor for CVD mortality. 33 In the Funagata Diabetes Study, IFG was not a risk factor Blood glucose categories: Normal, fasting glucose levels o5.6 mmol l \u00c01 ; IFG, fasting glucose levels 5.6-6.9 mmol l \u00c01 ; DM, fasting glucose levels X7.0 mmol l \u00c01 or medication for diabetes.", "for CVD mortality, although impaired glucose tolerance was a risk factor for CVD. 34 Compared with previous studies, our study has several methodological strengths. First, our cohort population was relatively large and was selected at random from an urban population in contrast to most other cohort populations in Asia, which were selected from rural populations. 15,20,34 Second, all of our cohort participants were examined at one place and measured using the same autoanalyzer at one laboratory. Finally, our study examined the risk of CVD incidence, not CVD mortality.", "In our study, we used the definitions of IFG and CVD/CHD set forth by the 2003 American Diabetes Association recommendations. In the Framingham Heart Study, the 2003 IFG definition was predictive of CHD in women but not in men, 17 a finding which was similar to our results. However, fewer studies have examined the association of the 2003 IFG definitions for CHD and stroke. Kanaya et al. 35 showed that the 2003 defination for IFG was not associated with increased risk of CHD or stroke among postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease.Kim et al. 36 reported that one-third of the population has IFG according to the 2003 definition. However, many of these individuals do not have increased prevalence of CHD.", "Hu et al. 19 reported that hypertension and DM increased stroke risk independently and that their combination additively increased stroke risk. In our study, the risks of CVD in the normoglycemic and IFG groups were linearly related to the BP category (P-value for trendo0.001). However, the risks of CVD in the DM group did not change with BP category (P-value for trend\u00bc0.4), which was compatible with a previous result for trends between glucose category and hypertension status. 20 Recently, the ACCORD BP Study has shown that targeting an SBP o120 mm Hg, as opposed to an SBP o140 mm Hg, did not reduce the rate of a composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. 37 Although present studies suggest that decreasing BP may be an effective way to prevent CVD in normoglycemic or IFG subjects, further investigations are required to clarify the interaction between the BP categories of DM subjects at risk for CVD in other large cohorts.", "The percentage of the PAF for CVD incidence in normoglycemic subjects with high-normal BP or IFG subjects with normal or highnormal BP (PAF\u00bc12.6%) was 1.5 times higher than that in the DM subjects in any BP category (PAF\u00bc8.2%). Also, the PAF suggested that 12.6% of CVD cases would be preventable if the borderline glucose and blood pressure levels were controlled to within normoglycemic and optimal BP ranges.", "Our results showed that hyperglycemia conferred a slightly higher risk of CVD incidence in women than in men, although men had greater absolute event rates for CVD. Previous studies have shown that the impact of DM on the risk of CVD is significantly greater in women than in men. 13,17,38 Lee et al. reported that the HRs of coronary heart disease for DM were 2.6 for women and 1.9 for men. In the Framingham Heart Study, 17 IFG was associated with increased CHD risk only in women (HR\u00bc1.7; 95% 1.0-3.0). The reason for these sex differences in the association between DM and CVD remains unclear.", "Our study has several limitations. The primary limitation is the regression dilution bias; this study was based on a single day measurement of serum glucose and BP levels. 39 That is, the fasting serum glucose and BP levels might have been misclassified. Second, as we did not perform glucose tolerance tests, we may have missed subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Finally, we did not examine the combined effect of BP categories and glucose abnormalities after stratification by CVD subtypes, such as stroke and CHD because of the small sample size.", "In conclusion, DM is a risk factor for CVD, stroke, and CHD, whereas an IFG of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol l \u00c01 is a risk factor for CVD and CHD in women. The risks of CVD in the normoglycemic and IFG groups were linearly related to the BP category. The high-normal BP subjects in any glucose categories and the normal BP subjects with IFG showed increased risks of CVD in this Japanese population. Further investigations of larger cohorts of DM subjects are needed."], "CONFLICT OF INTEREST": ["The authors declare no conflict of interest.

have examined the combined impact of blood pressure (BP) categories and glucose abnormalities on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general Asian population. This study aimed to examine the effect of the combined risks of these factors on the incidence of CVD in a general Japanese population. We studied 5321 Japanese individuals (aged 30-79 years), without CVD at baseline, who received follow-up for an average of 11.7 years. Serum fasting glucose categories were defined according to the 2003 American Diabetes Association recommendations. BP categories were defined by the 2009 Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension. The Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD according to the serum glucose and BP categories were calculated. In 62,036 person-years of follow-up, we documented 364 CVD events (198 stroke and 166 coronary heart disease (CHD)). Compared with normoglycemic subjects, the multivariable HRs (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for CVD, CHD and stroke were 1.25 (1.00-1.58), 1.46 (1.04-2.04) and 1.11 (0.81 1.52), respectively, in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), whereas these values were 2.13 (1.50-3.03), 2.28 (1.34-3.88) and 2.08 (1.29-3.35), respectively, in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM). Compared with normoglycemic and optimal blood pressure (BP) subjects, increased risks of CVD were observed in the normoglycemic subjects with high-normal BP or hypertension, the IFG subjects with normal or higher BP, and the DM subjects regardless of BP category (P-value for interaction=0.046). In conclusion, the high-normal BP subjects in all glucose categories and the normal BP subjects with IFG showed increased risk of CVD in this Japanese population. Further investigation of larger cohorts of DM subjects should be conducted to better understand this phenomenon."]}
