{"Abstract": ["Background-There are few published data on the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke in American Indians. The aims of this observational study were to determine the incidence of stroke and to elucidate stroke risk factors among American Indians. Methods and Results-This report is based on 4549 participants aged 45 to 74 years at enrollment in the Strong Heart Study, the largest longitudinal, population-based study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in a diverse group of American Indians. At baseline examination in 1989 to 1992, 42 participants (age-and sex-adjusted prevalence proportion 1132/100 000, adjusted to the age and sex distribution of the US adult population in 1990) had prevalent stroke. Through December 2004, 306 (6.8%) of 4507 participants without prior stroke suffered a first stroke at a mean age of 66.5 years. The age-and sex-adjusted incidence was 679/100 000 person-years. Nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction occurred in 86% of participants with incident strokes; 14% had hemorrhagic stroke.The overall age-adjusted 30-day case-fatality rate from first stroke was 18%, with a 1-year case-fatality rate of 32%. Age, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A 1c, smoking, albuminuria, hypertension, prehypertension, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for incident stroke. Conclusions-Compared with US white and black populations, American Indians have a higher incidence of stroke. The case-fatality rate for first stroke is also higher in American Indians than in the US white or black population in the same age range. Our findings suggest that blood pressure and glucose control and smoking avoidance may be important avenues for stroke prevention in this population."], "Baseline Evaluation": ["Information on demographic factors, medical history, medication use, and personal health habits (physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) was collected by personal interview. A physical examination was conducted, and fasting blood samples were collected for laboratory tests, including lipids, lipoproteins, and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Anthropometric measurements were performed, and sitting blood pressure (first and fifth Korotkoff sounds) was measured 3 times consecutively with mercury sphygmomanometers (WA Baum Co, Copiague, NY) after 5 minutes of rest. 11 The averages of the second and third systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were used in the analysis.", "Hypertension was defined by the criteria of the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC-7; systolic blood pressure \u0546140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure \u054690 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medication). 12 Prehypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 80 to 89 mm Hg. Normal blood pressure was defined as \u03fd120/80 mm Hg.", "Diabetes was defined by the 1998 Provisional World Health Organization Report 13 (fasting glucose \u05467.0 mmol/L [126 mg/dL] or post-75-g oral glucose challenge blood glucose of \u054611.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL], or use of an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin). Impaired glucose tolerance was defined as fasting glucose \u03fd7.0 mmol/L with postchallenge glucose between 7.8 and 11.09 mmol/L (140 to 199.9 mg/dL). Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting glucose between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/L (110 to 125.9 mg/dL) with postchallenge glucose \u03fd7.8 mmol/L. Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose were combined as 1 category designated as \"impaired glucose metabolism.\" Normal glucose tolerance was defined as fasting glucose \u03fd6.1 mmol/L with postchallenge glucose \u03fd7.8 mmol/L. Fasting insulin in serum or plasma was measured by radioimmunoassay according to established methods. 14 Microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were defined as urinary albumin/creatinine ratios of 30 to 299 mg/g and \u0546300 mg/g, respectively. Past smoking was defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in the subject's entire life, having smoked cigarettes regularly in the past, and not smoking currently. Current smoking was defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in the subject's entire life, having smoked cigarettes regularly, and smoking currently. Past alcohol users were defined as those who had consumed at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage in their entire life and who drank their last drink at least 1 year ago. Current alcohol users were defined as those who consumed at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage in their entire life and who were drinking currently. Information on leisure-time and occupation-related physical activities was collected with a physical activity questionnaire. This questionnaire has been validated in Pima Indians and other populations. An estimate of the individual's self-reported physical activity level was averaged over the past year and expressed as hours per week. 15,16 "], "Outcome Variables": ["Incident strokes included fatal and nonfatal events that occurred between the baseline examination and December 31, 2004, in participants without a prior history of stroke."], "Fatal Stroke": ["Fatal events included definite and possible fatal strokes. Deaths that occurred between the baseline examination and December 31, 2004, were confirmed through Indian Health Service or private hospital records and through direct contact by study personnel with participants' families or other informants. 1,8,9,17 The process of ascertaining stroke deaths has been reported previously. 1 Physician members of the Strong Heart Study Mortality Committee reviewed all medical records, information obtained from informants and death certificates, and coroner's or medical examiner's reports when available. Two reviewers reviewed each chart, and if there was lack of agreement, the chart was then reviewed by the entire adjudication committee. If reviewers found the death was stroke related, the case was sent to neurologists (D.O.W., J.P.W.) for confirmation with previously described criteria 17 that differentiated cardioembolic, lacunar, and other thrombotic cerebral infarctions; intraparenchymal (intracerebral) hemorrhage; subarachnoid hemorrhage; and stroke of unknown type. Mortality follow-up data were available in 99.8% of the participants."], "Nonfatal Stroke": ["The process to confirm nonfatal stroke was similar to that for fatal stroke. Neurologists (D.O.W., J.P.W.) made up the adjudication review committee and provided the final diagnosis for nonfatal events (definite and possible nonfatal strokes) that occurred from the baseline examination to the end of 2004 and for prevalent strokes that occurred before the baseline examination. 1,8,17,18 Stroke subtypes used were the same as described for fatal stroke. Transient ischemic attack was not included in the analysis. If more than 1 event occurred in the same individual, the date of the earliest event was considered the first stroke date."], "Statistical Analysis": ["Person-time incidence rates of stroke were calculated in male, female, and both male and female participants for 3 study centers. Age-specific rates and age-adjusted rates, age-and sex-adjusted rates, and their 95% CIs were calculated. The US 1990 population was used as the standard population in all age-adjustments.", "Overall and age-specific proportions of stroke subtypes among all strokes were provided. The proportion of persons with a history of stroke at baseline was calculated for males, females, and all participants for 3 centers. Age-specific, age-adjusted, and age-and sex-adjusted proportions and their 95% CIs were also calculated.", "Age-adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality rates and their 95% CIs for first stroke were calculated for both genders. Mean age at onset of first stroke was calculated for all incident stroke cases and cerebral infarction cases for 1989 to 2004 in both genders and 3 study centers.", "Baseline characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and LDL and HDL cholesterol are presented as means (SDs) for participants with or without incident stroke. The t test was used to compare means between 2 groups. Triglycerides, fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose, hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ), insulin, and physical activity are presented in quartiles (first quartile, median, third quartile). A nonparametric rank sum test 19 was used to compare the distribution of these variables between groups because of their skewed distributions. Proportions of women, prehypertension, hypertension, diabetes, macroalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, smoking, and alcohol use are presented in participants with and without incident stroke and were compared between groups by the 2 test. Two-tailed P\u03fd0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.", "The incidence of stroke was also calculated according to different categories of risk factors, including blood pressure, HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, diabetes, fasting glucose, HbA 1c , smoking, and albuminuria. The log-rank test was used to compare the incidence of stroke among the categories. The calculation of incidence and the log-rank test were adjusted for age and sex.", "Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess association of stroke with its potential risk factors, including age, gender, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, waist circumference, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria. Hypertension and prehypertension were entered in alternative models as categorical variables instead of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. All other covariates remained the same. Additional models considered HbA 1c or diabetes instead of fasting glucose; all other covariates remained the same. The multivariable analyses were done separately for all strokes and cerebral infarctions but not for hemorrhagic stroke because of the limited number of incident cases (n\u03ed37).", "The authors had full access to the data and take full responsibility for its integrity.

The aims of this observational study were to determine the incidence of stroke and to elucidate stroke risk factors among American Indians. METHODS AND RESULTS: This report is based on 4549 participants aged 45 to 74 years at enrollment in the Strong Heart Study, the largest longitudinal, population-based study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in a diverse group of American Indians. At baseline examination in 1989 to 1992, 42 participants (age- and sex-adjusted prevalence proportion 1132/100 000, adjusted to the age and sex distribution of the US adult population in 1990) had prevalent stroke. Through December 2004, 306 (6.8%) of 4507 participants without prior stroke suffered a first stroke at a mean age of 66.5 years. The age and sex-adjusted incidence was 679/100 000 person-years. Nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction occurred in 86% of participants with incident strokes; 14% had hemorrhagic stroke. The overall age-adjusted 30-day case-fatality rate from first stroke was 18%, with a 1-year case-fatality rate of 32%. Age, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A(1c,) smoking, albuminuria, hypertension, prehypertension, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for incident stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with US white and black populations, American Indians have a higher incidence of stroke. The case-fatality rate for first stroke is also higher in American Indians than in the US white or black population in the same age range. Our findings suggest that blood pressure and glucose control and smoking avoidance may be important avenues for stroke prevention in this population."]}
