{"Abstract": ["nondiabetic patients were directly related to cardiovascular risk. 3,4 The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for defining diabetes from fasting blood glucose levels of \u2265126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) were based on the fact that both the incidence and prevalence of microvascular disease-such as retinopathy and nephropathy-that represent a specific complication of diabetes, increased at this concentration. 5 These criteria replaced the previous World Health Organization (WHO) ones, which required fasting glucose levels of \u2265140 mg/dL (7.7 mmol/L) for the diagnosis of diabetes 6 and were provisionally agreed to by a WHO consultation. 7 In addition, in an attempt to simplify the diagnosis of diabetes, the need for an oral glucose tolerance test in routine practice was removed from the ADA recommendations. Levels of 110 to 125 mg/dL were designated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), a new category that partially overlaps positive tolerance tests. 5 This new ADA category for diabetes is not based on Glucose concentrations that are higher than the diabetes threshold constitute a well-established risk factor for heart disease. However, whether values below this threshold may be predictive of increased cardiovascular risk has not yet been fully elucidated and the issue is controversial. Although both early 1 and recent 2 observations did not find a consistent association between asymptomatic fasting hyperglycemia and coronary disease, other studies have argued that glucose levels in From the a Cardiac Rehabilitation Institute and the"], "Methods": [], "Subjects": ["The initial population consisted of 12,402 patients. Of these, 549 were excluded from analysis because of missing data. Thus the final study sample comprised 11,853 patients aged 45 to 74 years with a previous myocardial infarction (0.5 to 5 years before commencement of follow-up) or documented coronary disease (within 2 years preceding the examination), screened for participation but not included in the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study. 8 The design, major features, and ethical guidelines of the BIP study have been previously reported. 8 In brief, between February 1, 1990, and October 30, 1992, all eligible patients underwent a complete medical examination and biochemical blood tests; historic medical data, as well as data on drug therapy, were recorded. The major exclusion criteria for the BIP study were permanent pacemaker implantation, cerebrovascular disease, chronic hepatic or renal disease, peripheral vascular disease, malignant diseases, estrogen replacement therapy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.", "The patients included in the current analysis were divided into 3 groups on the basis of their fasting blood glucose concentrations at screening: (1) nondiabetic patients (glucose up to 109 mg/dL), (2) patients with IFG (glucose 110-125 mg/dL) and (3) undiagnosed diabetic patients (glucose \u2265126 mg/dL).

The diagnosis of IHD was made in patients with either documented myocardial infarction or in whom there was also a positive exercise test, evidence of myocardial ischemia revealed by radionuclear studies, or angiographic evidence of at least 60% stenosis of one major coronary artery. 8 Patients without a previous history of type 2 diabetes who were hyperglycemic (fasting blood glucose concentration of \u2265126 mg/dL) were defined as undiagnosed diabetics, and individuals with fasting concentrations of 110 to 125 mg/dL were considered as patients with IFG. This allocation is in keeping with the criteria of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus of the ADA. 5 Hypertension in undiagnosed diabetic patients was defined according to the criteria of the Working Group on Hypertension in Diabetes. 10 Mortality data were obtained by matching the patients' identification numbers with their life status in the Population Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification. Death certificates and diagnosis on hospital discharge were coded according to the system described in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), in which ischemic heart disease is denoted by codes 410 to 414. 11 "], "Statistical analysis": ["To evaluate the prognosis of nondiabetic subjects with known coronary artery disease and IFG over the 7.7-year follow-up period, data were analyzed with SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 12 Continuous variables were reported as mean values \u00b1 SD. Significance was determined with the chisquare test for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables. Age-adjusted mortality rates per 1000 person years were computed with a special SAS macro. 13 Actuarial survival curves by treatment groups were produced with use of the LIFETEST procedure. 14 The log-rank test was used for comparing the curves. Multivariate analysis of mortality was performed with the stepwise Cox proportional hazard model (PHREG procedure) to account for differing lengths of follow-up and correlation with covariates. Adjustment was made for age, sex, total cholesterol, triglycerides, previous myocardial infarction, functional class, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, anginal syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking status, and body mass index.

Therefore there is no a priori reason for the diabetes glucose thresholds to be relevant to the risk for these outcomes, and there is no reason that the glucose-cardiovascular relationship should not extend below the diabetes thresholds. 15 The prognostic significance of IFG on macrovascular complications is still unclear.", "The rate of cardiovascular disease has decreased in the general population, but it has remained stable or even increased in diabetics. Coronary patients with undiagnosed diabetes present a significantly increased long-term mortality. 16 Subjects with diabetes have increased morbidity and early mortality related to cardiovascular and microvascular complications. 17 The current report deals with long-term survival in a cohort of nondiabetic coronary patients with IFG. The main observation derived from the results of this study is the substantially increased mortality rate among these individuals."], "Survival": ["It is well established that all major cardiovascular risk factors-hypertension, hyperlipidemia-act as independent contributors to heart disease in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Several additional factors simultaneously affect the development of coronary disease and diabetes, such as insulin resistance, coagulation abnormalities, obesity, physical inactivity, heredity, sex, and advancing age. These predisposing conditions constitute the metabolic syndrome and exacerbate the major risk factors. 18 The role of hyperglycemia in this context was recently highlighted. Although there is no evidence that mild hyperglycemia per se promotes atherogenesis or plaque rupture, a 20year follow-up in the Whitehall Study, the Paris Prospective Study, and the Helsinki Policemen Study determined that a high blood glucose concentration is a risk factor for mortality in middle-aged nondiabetic subjects. 19 Most studies have provided support for a strong association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular mortality. [5][6][7][20][21][22][23][24] Previous findings of our laboratory showed that, after adjustment for all other risk factors, both men and women with asymptomatic hyperglycemia had the same elevated mortality rate as those with confirmed diabetes. 25 In the current study coronary patients with IFG were characterized by a worse outcome, with a greater hazard ratio for both all-cause and IHD mortality. Some early prospective studies of hyperglycemia and coronary disease showed no association between them, and other studies showed a positive association that was not persistent after adjustment for covariates. 26 On the contrary, later studies 19,27 are in keeping with our findings. The main cause of the discrepancies is that current diagnostic criteria were not in use when the early studies were conducted. 28 Thus, regardless of the underlying mechanisms that could explain the findings of this report, our results are in accordance with growing epidemiologic evidence that the risk for cardiovascular events does extend below the diabetic microvascular threshold. 29,30 "], "Study limitations": ["This was a prospective observational study where data were collected for different purposes, and we were aware of certain limitations. First, the majority of patients were men, so the degree to which the conclu-", "American Heart Journal March 2001 Fisman et al Figure 2", "Multivariate adjusted survival curves for all-cause mortality in nondiabetic subjects, patients with IFG, and undiagnosed diabetic patients. Note that at the end of the follow-up patients with IFG had a significantly higher mortality than nondiabetic individuals did (P < .01). "], "Table III.": ["Hazard ratios for all-cause and IHD mortality in the hyperglycemic groups during an average 7.7-year follow-up period sions apply to women is unclear. An earlier report from the same register showed a relative risk of death of 1.6 for all hyperglycemic patients, which rose to 2.4 when women were analyzed separately. 25 However, this finding probably does not affect the results because in the current study sex distribution was similar in all groups. Second, coding errors of ICD-9 are conceivable. Third, only a single glucose determination was performed at entry and no information was available regarding duration of hyperglycemia. In this context, it should be noted that some population studies indicate that cardiovascular mortality may not be dependent on duration of hyperglycemia because it is equally prevalent in both established and newly diagnosed diabetes. 31,32 Thus, despite these limitations, the results of our study may contribute to characterize the epidemiology of individuals with impaired levels of fasting glucose among a population with clinically established coronary disease."], "Clinical implications": ["A body of evidence is accumulating that suggests that all levels of dysglycemia, even those below current WHO and ADA diagnostic levels, are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. 3,30,[33][34][35][36][37] These levels may be as low as 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). 15 Our study is in keeping with this concept. The principal finding of the current report is the substantially increased mortality rate among nondiabetic coronary patients with IFG, who had fasting glucose levels markedly lower than hitherto acknowledged as defining overt diabetes. Thus the current study indicates that this new ADA category is a marker for worse prognosis in nondiabetic coronary patients, further supporting the hypothesis that there is a close-albeit not necessarily linear-relationship between glucose and cardiovascular disease that begins at normal levels and rises into the diabetic range. Problem-oriented prospective clinical trials are necessary to determine whether modification of dysglycemia translates into improved clinical outcomes or whether elevated glucose levels are simply markers of an underlying metabolic syndrome."], "all_tables": [["", "Table III).
