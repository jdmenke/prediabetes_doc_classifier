<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased dramatically in China and elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and T2DM is associated with a substantial increase in all-cause mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), also known as pre-diabetic state, has been shown to be a significant risk factor for T2DM. Moreover, IGT itself is significantly associated with microvascular and cardiovascular complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Studies have shown increased prevalence of retinopathy and chronic kidney disease among subjects with IGT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, and reversal of IGT to normal glucose regulation has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>With regards to mortality, the relationship between IGT and mortality remains uncertain, especially in the elderly. Previous studies showed a significant association between IGT and mortality in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. In contrast, Deedwania and colleagues observed that prediabetes was not an independent risk factor of mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, previous studies examining the relationship between IGT and all-cause mortality were conducted in diverse populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and seldom focused on IGT subjects. Furthermore, data on such relationship is limited in the elderly, particularly among older adults in China. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that IGT would predict all-cause mortality in older men in China.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study design</head><p>This is a prospective observational study. In this study, 460 community-dwelling older Chinese men were categorized as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or normal glucose tolerance (NGT) based on the results from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed between May 2005 and May 2007. All subjects were followed without any intervention until March 1, 2017. Recruitment, study procedures for data collection, and prospective follow-up were conducted at Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing and approved by the local ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Inclusion and exclusion criteria</head><p>Major inclusion criteria were community-dwelling men aged 60 years or older. Subjects meeting this inclusion criteria were administered an OGTT and categorized as isolated IGT or NGT accordingly. Major exclusion criteria included type 1 or type 2 diabetes; isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG); IFG plus IGT; use of medications that may affect glucose metabolism, such as glucocorticoids or thyroid hormones; history of an acute coronary, cerebrovascular accident, or other acute events such as operation, trauma, and infection within one month.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Study procedures</head><p>At baseline, an 8 h overnight fasting venous blood specimen was collected for the measurement of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), and creatinine. Information on demographic characteristics, personal and family medical history, physical examination, laboratory test outcomes were obtained. All participants were given a steamed bun which contained approximately 75 g of complex carbohydrates, and 2 h postprandial glucose (PPG) after carbohydrate load was measured using a Roche Accu-chek ® glucometer.</p><p>OGTT was performed in participants with PPG ≥ 7.2 mmol/L. Blood samples were drawn at 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h after glucose load to measure glucose and insulin concentration. IGT (0hPG &lt; 6.1 mmol/L and 7.8 ≤ OGTT 2hPG &lt; 11.1 mmol/L) and NGT (0hPG &lt; 6.1 mmol/L and OGTT 2hPG &lt; 7.8 mmol/L) were diagnosed according to the 1999 World Health Organization diagnostic criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. 2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension was used to diagnose hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Dyslipidemia was diagnosed according to 2016 Chinese guideline for the management of dyslipidemia in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was defined according to the 2005 IDF consensus worldwide definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. HOMA2 model was used to determine insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), ␤ cell function (HOMA2-%B), and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Insulin sensitivity index [ISI (composite)] during the OGTT was used to evaluate the whole-body insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Plasma glucose was measured with a glucose oxidase method. Serum TC, TG, LDL-c and HDL-c were determined with enzymatic methods using Cobas ® 8000 system (Roche Diagnostics). Serum insulin concentration was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit from American Diagnostic Products Corporation. The inter-assay coefficient of variability of insulin was 5.9-8.0%, and the intra-assay coefficient of variability was 5.2-6.4%. After the enrollment, participants were followed without any intervention except for a routine annual visit at which a physical examination and laboratory testing were performed. Laboratory tests included FPG, TC, TG, LDL-c, and HDL-c, and 2 h postprandial venous plasma glucose (2hPG). Participants with elevated FPG, elevated 2hPG, or history of increased plasma glucose during the follow-up would be recommended further laboratory evaluation including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or OGTT. HbA1c was measured using routine HPLC with a Variant II HbA1c analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). According to current guideline <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in which HbA1c ≥ 6.5% was used to diagnose T2DM. Information from participants' medical record was collected to confirm clinical diagnoses, medication use or events both at baseline and during follow-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Outcomes</head><p>The primary outcome in the time-to-event analysis was all-cause mortality. The secondary composite cardiovascular outcome was the first confirmed event of cardiovascular cause of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.</p><p>Other secondary outcomes included the first occurrence of heart failure, unstable angina, and cancer. Additional outcomes included incidence of T2DM, changes in FPG, 2hPG and HbA1c.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistics analysis</head><p>Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed continuous variables, and median (5th and 95th percentiles) for non-normal continuous variables.</p><p>Comparison of variables between groups was performed using unpaired Student's t test or 2 test; otherwise, non-parametric analysis was applied. The average HbA1c level in every following year was calculated in every subject. The HOMA2-IR level was divided into quartiles in the subgroup analyses, and subjects were categorized into two groups, the highest quartile and other quartiles. The main analysis used the timeto-first-event approach. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from Cox proportional-hazards models with number of years since baseline as the time scale. Person-time was calculated from the date of baseline until death or the end of follow-up (March 1, 2017). Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models were adjusted for the baseline variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, HOMA2-IR, eGFR, and history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and cancer. Independent significant risk factors for all-cause mortality were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. P values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Baseline characteristics</head><p>A total of 460 participants were enrolled into the study. There were 3 participants among the NGT group who did not have data regarding BMI, smoking history, or blood pressure at baseline. Fifteen (3.3%) participants were lost to follow-up. Of the 460 participants enrolled, 201 subjects (43.7%) had IGT at baseline as determined by OGTT. 22 cases in IGT group and 32 cases in NGT group were not included in the calculation of metabolic syndrome because there was no data of waist circumference at baseline. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes major baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. Age, BMI, SBP, FPG, and 2hPG level were higher in IGT group compared with those in the NGT group (P &lt; 0.05), while the proportion of smokers, level of DBP, TC, TG, LDL-c, HDL-c and eGFR were similar. Both study groups had similar frequencies of common medical diagnoses except for a greater incidence of hypertension in the IGT group than that in the NGT group (69.7% vs 54.4%, p &lt; 0.01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Insulin resistance and ˇ cell function</head><p>0hPG, 1hPG and 2hPG during OGTT at baseline in the IGT group were all significantly increased compared to the NGT group (P &lt; 0.001, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The 0hINS and 2hINS level in the IGT group were higher than the NGT group (P &lt; 0.01), and 1hINS  was similar between both groups. Serum insulin response rose progressively from 1 h to 2 h in the IGT group, while it declined after 1 h in the NGT group. Insulin resistance index HOMA2-IR in the IGT group was significantly higher than in the NGT group (P &lt; 0.01, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). ␤ cell function demonstrated as HOMA2-%B in the IGT group was also higher than in the NGT group, nearly achieving statistical significance (P = 0.052). Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and HOMA2-%S in the IGT group were both significantly lower than in the NGT group (P &lt; 0.01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Incident T2DM</head><p>The mean follow-up time was 11.2 years. Incident T2DM cases were 76 (37.8%) in the IGT group and 56 (21.6%) in the NGT group, and the risk for developing T2DM in the IGT group was 2.18 fold higher than in the NGT group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). After adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, HOMA2-IR, eGFR, and history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease, the IGT remained as a significant risk factor for developing T2DM compared to NGT (HR 2.26, 95%CI 1.58-3.22, P &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Glycemic control</head><p>At baseline, the mean FPG in the IGT group was higher than in the NGT group (5.25 ± 0.42 vs. 5.08 ± 0.38 mmol/L, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). During follow up, FPG increased gradually in both groups, though it remained higher in the IGT group than in the NGT group (e.g. FPG measurements at the end of the follow-up were 5.89 ± 0.89 vs. 5.64 ± 0.80 mmol/L, respectively, P = 0.017, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">A1</ref>).</p><p>Similarly, the mean 2hPG measured by glucometer in the IGT group was higher than in the NGT group (9.07 ± 1.23 vs. 8.49 ± 1.09 mmol/L, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) at baseline (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). While it increased gradually in both groups, the difference between the two groups remained statistically significant throughout follow-up (e.g., 2hPG measurements at the end of the follow-up were 9.86 ± 2.06 vs. 9.05 ± 1.96 mmol/L, respectively, P = 0.039).</p><p>While HbA1c was not measured at baseline, the two study groups did not differ significantly in the first year (5.76 ± 0.33 vs. 5.58 ± 0.31%, respectively, P = 0.166). However, HbA1c was measured in only a limited number of participants. Throughout follow-up, HbA1c increased gradually in both groups and became significantly higher in the IGT group than in the NGT group (e.g., HbA1c at the end of the follow-up were 6.22 ± 0.71 vs. 5.98 ± 0.42%, respectively, P = 0.009).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Cardiovascular outcomes and cancer</head><p>Compared with the NGT group, the IGT group had significantly increased risk for composite cardiovascular outcome, nonfatal stroke, and heart failure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction or unstable angina did not differ between the two groups. Multivariable models were constructed to assess the risk between the two study groups after adjusting for a number of important variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Model 1 was adjusted for age, BMI, and smoking. Model 2 was further adjusted for HOMA2-IR and eGFR based on model 1. Model 3 was further adjusted for history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease and cancer based on model 2. The risks of composite cardiovascular outcome, nonfatal stroke and heart failure in the IGT group remained significantly increased in all models (all P &lt; 0.05) compared to the NGT group.</p><p>On the other hand, incident cancer cases were 54 (26.9%) in the IGT group and 55 (21.2%) in the NGT group, and the risk of cancer was not significantly different between the two groups (HR = 1.40, 95%CI 0.96-2.04, P = 0.079).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">All-cause mortality</head><p>The primary outcome, all-cause mortality, was significantly higher in the IGT group (43, 21.4%) than in the NGT group (29, 11.2%) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.05 (95%CI 1.28-3.28, P = 0.003) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). After adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, HOMA2-IR, eGFR, hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and cancer, risk for all-cause mortality in the IGT group remained significantly higher than in the NGT group, with a HR of 1.94 (95%CI 1.19-3.14, P = 0.008). Further analyses have identified even higher risk for allcause mortality in subsets of participants in the IGT group compared to the same subsets in the NGT group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). For example, HR for those BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 was 2.81 (95%CI 1.25-6.32, P = 0.013); HR for non-smokers was 2.55 (95%CI 1.18-5.52, P = 0.017); HR for those with HOMA2-IR in the highest quartile was 4.03 (95%CI 1.25-13.0, P = 0.020); HR for those with hypertension was 2.84 (95%CI 1.49-5.41, P = 0.001); HR for those with dyslipidemia was 2.04 (95%CI 1.16-3.60, P = 0.014). When stratified by eGFR, compared with NGT group, the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher among those with eGFR 90 ml/min in the IGT group (HR 5.75, 95%CI 1.51-21.9, P = 0.010). However, no such subgroup difference was identified when stratified by age or coronary heart disease. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This study reports, for the first time, that IGT at baseline was associated with significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older Chinese men at high risk for CVD.

Data from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> has shown independent associations of diabetes with substantial premature death from vascular disease, several cancers, infectious diseases, and other causes. However, fewer studies have investigated the risk of all-cause mortality and disease-specific mortality in individuals with IGT, especially in older adults. One systematic review and meta-analysis sug-gests an association between IGT and all-cause mortality in a combined but diverse populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Europe (DECODE) Study has shown that IGT, not IFG, was predictive for all-cause mortality and deaths from cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study, while IGT was shown to be associated with all-cause mortality, it had no association with death from cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, a previous study in 637 older Finnish men investigated the association of glucose intolerance with death during a 5-year follow-up, and found that the relative risk of mortality among diabetic men (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.26-3.49) and among IGT men (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.71-1.94) was greater than compared to NGT men. This study demonstrated a significantly increased risk of death among older men with T2DM, but a non-statistically significant increased risk among older men with IGT <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Our study also focused on older men, but the difference between the 5 year Finnish study and our 11 year study may be the length of follow-up. T2DM had a much greater impact on participants compared to IGT, which may take longer to observe changes in outcomes. Furthermore, the duration of IGT may also be important given the well-established relationship between the duration of T2DM and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The Whitehall II study enrolled 5427 nondiabetic participants aged 50-79 years with a median of 11.5 years of follow-up, and suggested that prediabetes defined by FPG or 2hPG was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Similar to this study, our research had a participant follow-up of 11.2 years. The difference between the Whitehall II study and our study may be attributed to the age of participants. We found that the risk of mortality in men aged ≥75 years was significantly higher than that in older men aged &lt;75 years. Other inconsistencies between the results of these studies may be attributed to a number of variables including different diagnostic criteria and whether or not major risk factors were adjusted for. In addition, the average age of the participants at baseline was over 70 years old in the present study. This may have contributed to an effect on mortality in IGT subjects due to the increasing incidence with age of cardiovascular events, cancer, etc. Importantly, the participants in this study were at high risk for CVD due to a high prevalence of previous coronary heart disease, hypertension, and dyslipidemia at baseline, which may be another factor contributing to the difference between groups.</p><p>A recent study showed that IGT was associated with increased risk of mortality, but much of this increased risk was attributable to the development of T2DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Because the participants in this study were all IGT subjects, the development of T2DM during follow-up should play a significant role in mortality. However, our study focused on the different associated risk factors between IGT and NGT subjects. When logistic regression analysis was performed, we found that IGT, but not incident T2DM, was associated with increased all-cause mortality compared with NGT. During follow-up, development of T2DM occurred in both IGT and NGT groups. Nevertheless, in the IGT group, insulin resistance, baseline glucose abnormalities, and a higher incidence of diabetes during follow-up increased the likelihood of cardiovascular events. This finding from our work suggests a strong correlation between IGT and mortality. In addition, we also found that baseline age was the most important factor associated with death, except for composite cardiovascular outcome and incidence of cancer during follow-up.</p><p>An increased risk of composite cardiovascular outcome observed in participants with IGT in the present study is consistent with findings reported by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Endothelial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress have been described in individuals with IGT <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and is suggested to predict the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia are closely associated with IGT and taken together may also contribute to cardiovascular damage. In the present study, we report IGT as an independent predictor of nonfatal stroke and heart failure. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a significant association between prediabetes and an increased future risk of stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. We did not observe increased events of coronary heart disease, i.e. nonfatal myocardial infarction or unstable angina in this study. This is likely due to the requirement of PPG ≥ 7.2 mmol/L for all participants prior to administration of OGTT. This stringent criterion may have led to missing participants with NGT, attenuating the difference between IGT group and NGT group. Alternatively, clustering of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia rather than hyperglycemia alone may significantly influence such cardiovascular events.</p><p>The primary difficulty encountered during this study is subject follow-up. The mean follow-up time in the present study was 11.2 years. Participants showed good compliance with just fifteen (3.3%) participants lost to follow-up. The remaining participants were followed throughout the study until death or the completion of the trial, and received at least one visit per year to perform physical examination and laboratory tests. The major strengths of this study include the longitudinal nature of the study with a follow-up period of over 11 years and minimal lost to follow-up of study participants. In addition, all clinical diagnoses and events during follow-up were closely monitored and confirmed. We also carefully adjusted a number of potential confounding factors in our analyses. However, this study also has several limitations. For example, a participant PPG ≥ 7.2 mmol/L measured by glucometer was required prior to performing OGTT. This requirement may be biased towards IGT detection and ultimately attenuate the differences between the IGT and NGT study groups. Other limitations include the reliance on a single OGTT to discern glucose metabolism at baseline, and a limited number of 2 h plasma glucose measurements during follow-up. In addition, the possibility of other confounding factors cannot be completely eliminated due to the observational nature of this study.</p></div>
