<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combinations of blood pressure and glucose tolerance status on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. A total of 7619 participants aged ⩾ 30 years old were stratified to nine categories as follows:</p><p>(1) normotension (NTN) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (reference group), (2) NTN and pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM), (3) NTN and DM, (4) pre-hypertension (pre-HTN) and NGT, (5) pre-HTN and pre-DM, (6) pre-HTN and DM, (7) HTN and NGT, (8) HTN and pre-DM and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) HTN and DM. Cox proportional hazards were applied to calculate the multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) of different groups for outcomes. For all-cause mortality outcomes, prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) was also adjusted. In a median follow-up of 11.3 years, 696 CVD and 412 all-cause mortality events occurred. Among the population free from CVD at baseline (n = 7249), presence of HTN was associated with increased risk of CVD, regardless of glucose tolerance status with HRs of 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.49-2.61), 2.25 (1.68-3.02) and 3.16 (2.28-4.37) for phenotypes of HTN and NGT, HTN and pre-DM and HTN and DM for CVD, respectively; corresponding HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.65 (95% CI, 1.15-2.37), 1.69 (1.15-2.49) and 2.73 (1.80-4.14), respectively. Phenotypes of NTN and pre-DM (1.48; 1.03-2.14) and NTN and DM (2.04; 1.06-3.92) were also associated with CVD and all-cause mortality, respectively. HTN was significantly associated with CVD/mortality events, regardless of glucose tolerance status. Blood pressure o120/80 mm Hg among pre-diabetic/diabetic population, not on antihypertensive medications, was generally associated with worse outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PATIENTS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p>Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study is a community-based cohort study initiated between March 1999 and December 2001, and conducted on a representative sample of Tehranian population. Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study carried out to determine the prevalence of various risk factors and their association with non-communicable diseases. Detailed descriptions of the study methods have been reported elsewhere; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> to date, five phases of the study have been carried out (starting from 1999 to 2015 with 3-year intervals).</p><p>A total number of 15 005 of participants were entered during first phase (1999-2002) and 3550 during second phase of the study (2002-2005); among which 9752 participants aged ⩾ 30 years were considered in the current study. Exclusions included those with missing data on systolic or diastolic BP (n = 423), FPG or 2 h-PCPG test (n = 783), missing data on covariates (n = 178) or without any follow-up data (n = 749), leaving 7619 participants who were followed till March 2012, with a median of 11.3 years. Also, to investigate the impact of different combinations of glucose tolerance and BP status on incident CVD/CHD events, participants with prevalent CVD were excluded from the analysis, leaving 7249 participants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The protocol of study was approved by ethics committee of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and written informed consents were obtained from all participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical and laboratory measurement</head><p>Participants were interviewed face-to-face by trained interviewer using a standard questionnaire; information documented included demographic data (sex, age and education status), smoking and family history of premature CVD plus history of medication use.</p><p>Details of anthropometric measures regarding height, weight, waist circumferences and hip circumference using standard protocols have been previously published elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio were calculated by dividing weight (kg) to height (m 2 ) and waist circumference to hip, respectively.</p><p>A standardised mercury sphygmomanometer (calibrated by the Iranian Institute of Standards and Industrial Researches) was used to measure SBP and DBP on the right arm after a 15 min rest in the sitting position; for each participant, two measurements were performed and mean of two measurements was considered as the participant's BP.</p><p>After 12-14 h overnight fasting, a blood sample was taken from all participants and centrifuged within 30-45 min of collection. For the oral glucose tolerance test, 75 g glucose was administered orally to the subjects who did not use anti-diabetic medications, and plasma glucose was measured 2 h after. Details of laboratory assessments including FPG, 2 h-PCPG and total cholesterol have been reported elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of terms</head><p>The participants were categorised according to their BP and diabetes status into nine categories as follows: (1) normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and NTN (reference group), (2) NTN and pre-DM, (3) NTN and DM, (4) pre-HTN and NGT (5) pre-HTN and pre-DM, (6) pre-HTN and DM, (7) HTN and NGT, (8) HTN and pre-DM and (9) HTN and DM. According to the Joint National Committee 7 definition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> HTN was defined as SBP ⩾ 140 mm Hg or DBP ⩾ 90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication, and pre-HTN was defined as 120 mm Hg ⩽ SBP o 140 mm Hg or 80 mm Hg ⩽ DBP o90 mm Hg. DM and pre-DM were defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria; 10 DM as FPG ⩾ 7 mmol l − 1 or a 2 h-PCPG ⩾ 11.1 mmol l − 1 or using anti-diabetic medication; pre-DM as 5.55 mmol l − 1 ⩽ FPG o 7 mmol l − 1 or 7.77 mmol l − 1 ⩽ 2 h-PCPG o11.1 mmol l − 1 . Population with FPG o5.55 mmol l − 1 and 2 h-PCPG o7.77 without using anti-diabetic medication was considered as NGT.</p><p>Hypercholesterolemia was defined as serum total cholesterol ⩾ 6.21 mmol l − 1 or using lipid-lowering medication. We defined ever smoking as participants who had past or current usage of cigarettes or water pipe or pipe. Education was classified into three groups as follows: illiterate/primary school, under diploma and upper diploma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of outcomes</head><p>Details of cardiovascular data have been published elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Briefly, participants were followed up by phone calls from a trained nurse every year regarding any medical event leading to their hospitalisation in the past year and then complimentary data were obtained by a trained physician during a home or hospital visit. Data then were evaluated by an outcome committee consisting of a principal investigator, an internist, an endocrinologist, an epidemiologist, a cardiologist, the physician who gathered data and other experts if needed. The committee then assigned a specific diagnosis for each event. Cases of CHD events included those with definite myocardial infarction (diagnostic electrocardiogram and biomarkers), probable myocardial infarction (positive electrocardiogram findings with cardiac symptoms or signs in the presence of negative or equivocal biomarker results), unstable angina pectoris (new cardiac symptoms or changing symptom patterns and positive electrocardiogram findings with normal biomarkers), and angiographically proven CHD or CHD death. CVD outcomes were considered as any CHD events, cerebrovascular accidents or CVD deaths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Baseline characteristics of the participants were shown as mean (s.d.) and frequency (%) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Comparisons between different groups of glucose tolerance and blood pressure status regarding baseline characteristics were performed using one way analysis of variance or χ 2 -tests, as appropriate.</p><p>Incidence rate of mortality with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each group by dividing the total number of incident mortality to the sum of person times of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations between each group with all-cause mortality. Survival time was calculated from the start of the follow-up period to the date of the first incident CVD/CHD or mortality event (failure). Censoring time was from the time of the individual's entrance to the study until loss to follow-up or end of the study, whichever happened first. We performed the analysis for CVD and CHD outcome in two models; model 1 was only adjusted for sex and age, while model 2 was further adjusted for other confounder variables including BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, smoking, hypercholesterolemia and education. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were reported with 95% CI, considering NGT and NTN group as the reference. The assumption of Cox proportional hazard model was assessed graphically using Schoenfeld's residuals test.</p><p>We found no interaction between sex and different groups using likelihood ratio test (P-value = 0.214); hence the analyses were carried out in pooled sex samples to reach full statistical power. Furthermore, interactions of prevalent CVD and different groups were also examined in multivariate model for all-cause mortality and no interaction was found (P-value = 0.294); hence, the prevalent CVD was adjusted in multivariate analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (SPSS for Windows, Version 20.0.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and STATA version 12  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Baseline characteristics of participants according to their glucose tolerance and BP status have been presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Mean age of participants were 46.8 years and ~46% of them were males. There was significant differences in baseline characteristics, among groups including age, BMI, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, SBP, DBP, FPG, 2 h-PCPG, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and educational status. Baseline characteristics of participants with and without mortality events have been presented in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Over a median follow-up of 11.3 years, 696 CVD, 595 CHD and 412 all-cause mortality events occurred. As shown in As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> regarding mortality events as like as for CVD, in every glucose tolerance phenotypes, the presence of HTN increased the risk of mortality events with HRs of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.15-2.37), 1.69 (95% CI, 1.15-2.49) and 2.73 (95% CI, 1.80-4.14) for HTN and NGT, HTN and pre-DM, and HTN and DM, respectively, in multivariate-adjusted model. Furthermore, the NTN and DM groups had a 100% increased risk for mortality events (HR: 2.04 (1.06-3.92)). No other groups showed significant risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine the impact of different combination of glucose tolerance and BP status with CVD and all-cause mortality during more than a decade follow-up. In comparison to the reference, the hypertensive groups in the presence of diabetes showed a significant risk of more than twofold for CVD/CHD and all-cause mortality events. Furthermore, the pre-HTN and DM group showed a significant risk of about 70% for CVD events. The NTN and DM group highlighted a 100% increased risk for mortality events. Finally, the NTN and pre-DM group showed about 50% increased risk in multivariate analysis for CVD/CHD events.</p><p>Although, DM and HTN are well-known risk factors for CVD and all-cause mortality events, population-based studies examining the impact of different combinations of glucose tolerance and BP status on these outcomes are scarce. Similar to our findings, a population-based study conducted in China showed significant risk for CVD events for HTN groups, whether per se alone or in the presence of glucose intolerance status. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> In the current study, the presence of pre-HTN increased the risk of CVD by about 71% among the population with DM. The researchers of the Strong heart study showed HR 42 for patients with DM in the presence of NTN or pre-HTN status only for CVD events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Pre-HTN, as a pre-disease risk factor, was reported to be associated with CVD/CHD but not all-cause mortality events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Among Iranian adults, we previously found that the risk of pre-HTN for CVD events was limited to middle aged population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> In another study conducted among Turkish population, it was also shown the independent risk of pre-HN for CHD as well as DM only among women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> In the current study, we extended our findings and showed that among different phenotypes of glucose tolerance status, the CVD risk of pre-HTN was found only among those with DM. Unlike to the studies conducted among American and Chinese population, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> we found a risk of about 50% for CVD events among the pre-DM population in the presence of BP o120/80 mm Hg. Recent meta-analysis conducted by Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> showed that the risk of CHD was increased in participants with impaired fasting glucose tolerance defined by the American Diabetes Association or WHO criteria. On the other hand, among non-diabetic Turkish population, it was shown that the impact of impaired fasting glucose was modulated by the presence of metabolic syndrome; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> on the other hand, impaired glucose tolerance alone, independently predicted CHD risk among women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Data from 19 European cohorts including 12 566 men and 10 874 women with both FPG and 2 h-PCPG within the normoglycemic range showed high 2 h-PCPG was associated  increased CVD mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> In the current study, we defined pre-DM as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, and did not stratify the pre-DM group, considering the limited number of events. The current study extends findings of previous studies by showing all-cause mortality as the outcome of interest in which we observed increased risk in all of the individuals with HTN, regardless of glucose tolerance status. Although association of HTN with all-cause and CVD mortality is not a new finding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> our study clarifies that this association persists even in those with NGT. Furthermore, we showed that compared with NFG/NGT population, BP o 120/80 mm Hg among diabetic individuals, not on antihypertensive medications, increased all-cause mortality risk by about 100%, although the diabetic population with pre-HTN had no significant risk. In line with our study, the recent Kailuan Study conducted among a Chinese diabetic population showed that baseline BP o 120/80mm Hg was significantly associated with incident all-cause mortality but not with CVD, relative to BP of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows that among the study population, NTN patients with type 2 DM are more likely to be male and smoker and have higher FPG but lower BMI, compared to the other groups. Furthermore, we showed that among the diabetic population, being male, having lower BMI or high FPG and being a smoker were independent risk factors for mortality events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> Moreover, diabetic patients may experience other diseases such as infection that result in impaired cardiac output and abnormal vasodilatation, showing a decrease in blood pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Hence, as reported by WU Z et al., a relatively low BP may reveal the evolution toward complex diabetic comorbidities and mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> In the current study, we extend the results of WU Z et al. by showing a similar trend among a pre-DM population with BP o 120/80, with increased risk of 48% for CVD, whereas the presence of pre-HTN with pre-DM was not associated with any risk.</p><p>Regarding the presence of both pre-DM and pre-HTN, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found US adults showing this phenotype had a worse CVD risk profile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> with authors concluding that these populations are on an accelerated pathway to early CVD events. Despite the high prevalence and incidence of pre-HTN and pre-DM among Iranian populations, 4,5 however, we found no risk in our population with coexisting pre-HTN and pre-DM for CVD and mortality outcomes. Importantly, these findings should be interpreted with caution; in fact, the statistical power of study was 43% to detect HR of 1.27 of pre-HTN and pre-DM groups for CVD.</p><p>To mention the study limitations, first, as inherent in any prospective study, level of risk factors at the baseline examination might have changed during the follow-up period. As such, some degree of misclassification might have occurred, leading to biased estimated HRs toward the null. Second, our definitions for DM did not include HbA1c, so it is possible that some cases not diagnosed using FPG or 2 h-PCPG may have been missed. Third, we did not sex-stratify our data analysis considering the absence of interactions between gender and different categories of glucose tolerance and blood pressure for different outcomes, as shown in other studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Fourth, this study has been conducted on a sample of Iranian population living in Tehran and further studies should be conducted to determine whether our findings could be applicable to other populations. As strengths, this is among the first studies to examine the impact of different combinations of glycemic levels and BP status with all-cause mortality outcomes and the third one regarding CVD/CHD. Also, the length of followup and using actual measurements of variables and outcomes rather than self-reported data are other strengths of this study. Furthermore, we used both FPG and 2 h-PCPG to categorise our participants into the pre-DM and NGT groups.</p><p>To conclude, HTN caused significant increase in risk of CVD/CHD and all-cause mortality regardless of glucose tolerance status, indicating the importance of controlling HTN for CVD prevention even among NGT populations. Furthermore, we showed that blood pressure o 120/80 mm Hg among pre-diabetic and diabetic populations, not on antihypertensive medications, was generally associated with worse health outcomes. And the last but not least, the presence of both pre-disease states was not associated with any risk for CVD/CHD or mortality. Considering the observational nature of this study, these findings should be confirmed in context of clinical trials for obtaining definite conclusion.</p><p>What is known about the topic?</p><p>• It is well-known that hypertension and diabetes have significant role in cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.</p><p>What this study adds?</p><p>• Hypertension is associated with increased risk of CVD and mortality events, regardless of glucose tolerance status. • The presence of both pre-diabetes and pre-hypertension was not associated with any risk for CVD/CHD or mortality events. • Blood pressure o120/80 mm Hg among pre-diabetic/diabetic population, not on antihypertensive medications, was generally associated with worse health outcomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
