<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Aims The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors characterized by insulin resistance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and results</head><p>The MetS was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR), the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), the American College of Endocrinology (ACE), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the American Heart Association (updated NCEP) criteria. We investgated the relationship of the MetS defined by aforementioned six criteria with CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality with Cox regression analyses in a non-diabetic Finnish population of 1025 subjects, aged 65-74 years, during the 13-year follow-up. The MetS defined by all aforementioned criteria was associated with a statistically significant risk for CVD mortality when adjusted for all confounding variables (Hazards Ratios, HRs from 1.31 to 1.51). The MetS defined by the WHO, ACE, and IDF criteria was associated with an increased risk of CHD mortality (HRs from 1.42 to 1.58). There was no association between the MetS by any criteria and all-cause mortality. Of the single components of the MetS, the following predicted CVD mortality in multivariable models: impaired fasting glucose by the WHO, NCEP, and ACE criteria (HR 1.34) and by the IDF and updated NCEP criteria (HR 1.29); impaired glucose tolerance by the WHO and ACE criteria (HR 1.55); low HDL cholesterol by the EGIR criteria (HR 1.50) and by the NCEP, IDF, and updated NCEP criteria (HR 1.29); and microalbuminuria according to the WHO definition (HR 1.86).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The MetS defined by all six current criteria predicts CVD mortality in elderly subjects. However, of the single components of the MetS, IFG, IGT, low HDL cholesterol, and microalbuminuria predicted CVD mortality with equal or higher HRs when compared with the different definitions of the MetS. Therefore, our study suggests that the MetS is a marker of CVD risk, but not above and beyond the risk associated with its individual components.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline study</head><p>The formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> and representativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> of the study population have been described in detail previously. Briefly, the study was conducted in Kuopio, east Finland, in 1986-1988. Altogether 1910 subjects born between 1912 and 1921 were randomly selected from the population register including all inhabitants of Kuopio. This random sample covered 35% of all residents in the age group of 65-74 years. The overall participation rate was 71%. All subjects with a previous history of diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes at the baseline study were excluded from the present analyses. The WHO criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus were used in the classification of subjects without previously known diabetes based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h post glucose load (2-h PG) values at baseline. Thus, a total of 1025 non-diabetic subjects aged 65-74 years were included in the current study.</p><p>Weight, height, waist, and hip circumference, and blood pressure were measured. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was defined as waist circumference to hip circumference. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres. Smoking status was defined as current smoking. With respect to alcohol consumption, subjects were classified as alcohol users or nonusers. Physical activity during leisure time was classified as physically inactive (little and occasional activity) and physically active (regular exercise at least once a week and at least 30 min per time).</p><p>ECGs were classified according to the Minnesota code. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> Previous verified definite and possible myocardial infarction (MI) prior the baseline study were defined according to the WHO MONICA project criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> as modified by the FINMONICA AMI Register Study Group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> WHO criteria for definite and possible stroke were used in the ascertainment of the previous stroke. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> Blood samples were taken in the morning after a 12 h overnight fast. All subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (75 g glucose). Plasma glucose and insulin, serum lipids and lipoproteins, and urinary albumin were determined as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> Ratio of urinary albumin (mg/L) to urinary creatinine (mmol/L) (ACR) was used as a measure of albumin excretion.</p><p>The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Kuopio University Hospital. All study subjects gave informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up study</head><p>Medical records of all study subjects who participated in the baseline study in 1986-1988 were reviewed by 2 of the authors (S.R, J.K.). Copies of death certificates of all those who had died during the 13-year follow-up were obtained from medical records or from the files of the Central Statistical Office in Finland and reviewed (S.R., J.K.). Deaths were recorded until the end of June, 2001, and they were coded according to the 9th revision of the international Classification of Disease (ICD-9). CHD death during the follow-up was defined as a death resulting from CHD (ICD-9 codes 410 to 414). ICD-9 codes 390 to 459 were classified as CVD deaths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions of the MetS</head><p>In the present study, each component of the six definitions of the MetS was defined according to the original criteria. Criteria for all current definitions of the MetS, including the WHO, the EGIR, the NCEP, the ACE, the IDF, and the updated NCEP definitions are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>All statistics were performed with the SPSS 11.5 statistical programs. Because of the skewed distribution of fasting insulin, triglyceride concentrations, and ACR, these variables were log transformed for statistical analyses. Univariable Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate the effect of risk factors listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> on the risk of CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality. The variables not included in the definitions of MetS, showing a statistically significant association with CVD, CHD, or all-cause mortality in the univariable Cox models, were added into the multivariable Cox regression models as confounders. The multivariable Cox regression analyses were applied to investigate the association of the MetS defined by the six criteria with CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality in confounder adjusted models (Model 1: adjusted for age and gender; Model 2: adjusted for age, gender, history of MI and stroke, current smoking, consumption of alcohol, physical activity at leisure time, and total cholesterol). A product term of gender by each of six definitions was added to the model to represent interaction. The null hypothesis of no interaction was tested using the change in 22 log likelihoods between Cox models with and without the product term. The effect of the single components of the MetS on CVD mortality was tested by the multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for confounding factors. A P-value ,0.05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant. Exact P-values and confidence intervals (CI) are given in tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The median follow-up was 13.5 years (the 25th and the 75th quartiles were 9.7 and 14.2 years, respectively). Of the 1025 non-diabetic subjects who participated in the baseline study, 629 subjects were alive on 30 June 2001. There were 443 deaths during the follow-up. A total of 250 individuals died of CVD, including 148 deaths due to CHD. Men had higher CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality than women (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). In multivariable Cox regression analyses, male sex, age, previous MI and stroke, current smoking, physical inactivity, SBP, and ACR were associated with increased CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality. High total cholesterol was associated with mortality from CHD. Fasting insulin was related to CVD mortality (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows hazard ratios (HRs) of the MetS defined by the six different criteria to predict CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality during the 13-year follow-up. The prevalence of the MetS at baseline depended on the MetS criteria, varying from 22.5 (EGIR criteria) to 66.4% (ACE criteria). When adjusted for age and gender (Model 1), the MetS by the WHO, ACE, and updated NCEP criteria was associated with a 1.40-to 1.72-fold risk for CHD mortality. The MetS  by all six definitions was associated with a statistically significant 1.32-to 1.56-fold risk for CVD mortality. Only the WHO definition was predictive of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.21, 95%CI 1.01-1.46). After further adjustment for history of MI and stroke, current smoking, consumption of alcohol, physical activity at leisure time, and total cholesterol (Model 2), the MetS defined by the WHO, ACE, and the IDF criteria was associated with a statistically significant 1.42-to 1.58-fold risk for CHD mortality. The MetS by all six criteria was associated with a 1.31-to 1.51-fold risk for CVD mortality when adjusted for all aforementioned confounding factors. None of the definitions predicted allcause mortality when adjusted for all confounders. Of the six criteria for the MetS, only the WHO and ACE definitions predicted both CHD and CVD mortality in both of the aforementioned two models. Interaction terms between the gender and the MetS by the WHO and ACE definitions were significant for CHD and CVD mortality (P , 0.05). Therefore, we investigated the association of the MetS by all six definitions with the risk for CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality separately in men and women (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). In men, the MetS defined by the WHO (HR 1.97), ACE (HR 2.23), and IDF criteria (HR 1.58) was associated with a statistically significant risk for CHD mortality. The MetS defined by the WHO (HR 1.70) and ACE criteria (HR 1.71) were associated with an increased risk for CVD mortality in men. In women, the MetS did not predict CHD or CVD mortality by any criteria. None of the definitions predicted all-cause mortality in men or women.</p><p>We also repeated statistical analyses excluding subjects with CVD at baseline (n ¼ 213). The HRs of the MetS by different criteria for CHD mortality were very similar to those in the whole study population (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), with the exception of the MetS defined by the ACE and IDF criteria which did not predict CHD mortality [adjusted HRs in Model 2: 1.57 (0.96-2.56); 1.55 (0.98-2.45), respectively]. The associations of the MetS by different criteria with CVD mortality were quite similar to those presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, with the exception of the MetS defined by the EGIR, which was not predictive of CVD mortality in any of the models. No association of any definitions of the MetS with all-cause mortality was found (data not shown).</p><p>We also investigated if the MetS defined by the IDF, NCEP, and updated NCEP criteria predicted CVD and CHD mortality in non-diabetic subjects without microalbuminuria or IGT at baseline. After excluding subjects with microalbuminuria, the MetS by IDF criteria (HR 1.51 and 1.37, respectively), but not by NCEP and updated NCEP criteria, predicted CHD, and CVD mortality (n ¼ 827). After excluding study subjects with IGT, the MetS did not predict CHD and CVD mortality by any criteria (n ¼ 809), and the HRs were lower (1.03-1.24).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows HRs for the single components of the MetS definitions for CVD mortality in multivariable Cox regression models after the adjustment for confounding factors in all subjects and by gender. Of the single components of the MetS, the following predicted CVD mortality in all subjects: IFG (FPG .6.1 mmol, HR 1.34) according to the WHO, NCEP, and ACE criteria; IGT (2-h 7.8-11.0 mmol/L, HR 1.55) according to the WHO and ACE criteria; low HDL cholesterol according to the EGIR criteria (HDL cholesterol ,1.0 mmol, HR 1.50); and microalbuminuria (ACR .3.39 mg/mmol, HR 1.86) according to the WHO definition. Of the single components of the MetS, only microalbuminuria (HR 1.75 for men, HR 1.99 for women) and IGT (HR 1.61 for men, HR 1.40 for women) predicted CVD mortality in both sexes when adjusted for confounding variables. In men, IGT (HR 1.61), upper quartile of insulin (HR 1.48), BMI over 30 kg/m 2 (HR 1.63), low HDL cholesterol according to the EGIR criteria (HDL cholesterol , 1.0 mmol, HR 1.71), and according to the NCEP, IDF, and updated NCEP criteria (HDL cholesterol ,1.03 mmol/L in men, HR 1.57) were predictive of CVD mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study, the MetS defined by all six current criteria predicted CVD mortality in the elderly population. Moreover, the MetS defined by the WHO, ACE, and IDF criteria predicted CHD mortality. None of the MetS definitions predicted all-cause mortality. The MetS, however, did not predict CVD mortality beyond and above of four of its single components, namely IFG, IGT, low HDL cholesterol, and microalbuminuria. Of the single components of the The metabolic syndrome predicts cardiovascular mortality MetS, IGT and microalbuminuria had the highest HRs for CVD mortality. Accordingly, the WHO and ACE criteria for the MetS, which include IGT and microalbuminuria in their definitions, predicted most consistently CVD and CHD mortality.</p><p>Several prospective studies have evaluated the value of the NCEP and WHO definitions to predict CHD, CVD, and allcause mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> However, most of these studies have used modified definitions other than those originally proposed. Moreover, these studies have varied with respect to characteristics of the baseline population, number of deaths, and statistical analyses. The Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study 11 reported that both the NCEP and WHO criteria predicted all-cause, CHD, and CVD mortality after the adjustment for age, examination year, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, and family history of CHD in 1209 men aged 42-60 years without initial diabetes and CVD. However, an oral glucose tolerance test was not performed. In contrast, the San Antonio Heart Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> including 2372 participants, aged 25-64 years, without initial diabetes and CVD showed that after the adjustment for age, gender, and ethnic group, neither the modified WHO definition (microalbuminuria excluded) nor the NCEP definition predicted all-cause mortality, but the latter was associated with a 2-fold risk of CVD mortality. The Hoorn study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> investigated whether the EGIR, NCEP, WHO (microalbuminuria excluded), and ACE definitions predicted 10-year risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD in 615 men and 749 women without diabetes and self-reported CVD at baseline. The results showed that the NCEP, EGIR, and ACE definitions predicted all-cause mortality, and only the NCEP definition was predictive of CVD mortality in men, whereas among women, there was no association of the MetS defined by any definition with mortality from all-cause and CVD. Clearly, the modification of the definition, differences in covariates, and the number of study subjects and outcomes have resulted in inconsistent findings with respect to the importance of the MetS as a cardiovascular risk factor.</p><p>Since one of main purpose of the working definitions for the MetS has been to establish a useful clinical tool to identify individuals at high risk for CVD, it is important to investigate whether the current six definitions for the Met predict CVD morbidity and mortality, and compare their ability to predict mortality in one study population, as we have done in the present study. Compared with the previous studies, the present study has several advantages. First, to our knowledge, this is the first prospective population-based study investigating the relationship between CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality and the MetS defined by all the six current criteria and including all components of each definition. Second, our study has a large number of deaths (445 deaths) due to a long which ensures an adequate power of statistical analyses. Third, as diabetes is a powerful predictor of mortality independently of the MetS, an oral glucose tolerance test was used to exclude all diabetic subjects from our study. Fourth, we also investigated the MetS as a predictor of mortality in subjects without CVD at baseline. Fifth, when we studied the MetS as a predictor of CHD, CVD, and all-cause death, mortality rates were adjusted for confounding variables showing a statistically significant association with CVD or CHD mortality. Finally, our study was performed in a population of elderly subjects, in whom most events of cardiovascular disease occur.</p><p>In the present study, we also studied the MetS as a predictor of CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality separately in men and women. The MetS predicted CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality only in men, not in women. However, mortality rates were significantly lower in women than in men, suggesting that the lack of statistical power may explain this gender difference. Also a previous study, based on 11 prospective European cohorts, found that the relative risk of CVD and all-cause mortality associated with the MetS was similar in men and women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> It has remained unclear whether the MetS predicts CVD mortality better than its single components. In the present study, we found that of the single components of the MetS, particularly IGT and microalbuminuria, but also IFG and low HDL cholesterol were predictive of CVD mortality. Accordingly, the WHO and ACE criteria for the MetS, which include IGT and microalbuminuria in their definitons, most consistently predicted CVD and CHD mortality and had the highest HRs in different statistical models. In contrast, when subjects with microalbuminuria or IGT were excluded, the predictive power of the MetS was significantly attenuated. Our findings support the findings of previous prospective studies, including our study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> which have shown that microalbuminuria predicts CHD and CVD morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality independently of other risk factors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> and that subjects with IGT have markedly higher risk for all-cause and CVD mortality than subjects with IFG. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> As the MetS did not have higher HRs for CVD mortality than its single components, our study suggests that the MetS does not predict CHD and CVD above and beyond its components. Our findings are in concordance with a recent case-control study showing that the MetS defined by the NCEP and updated NCEP criteria was not associated with a greater risk of early-onset coronary artery disease than individual components of the MetS, such as low HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and IFG. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> A limitation of our study is the absence of middle-aged individuals in the cohort. Our study included only elderly subjects which may lead to survival bias. In addition, there was a limited number of CHD and CVD deaths when analyses were done separately for men and women. Furthermore, because of several definitions of the MetS, multiple testing increases the likelihood of false positive P-values.</p><p>In conclusion, the MetS defined by all six current criteria predicts CVD mortality in the elderly. However, four single components of the MetS, namely IFG, IGT, low HDL cholesterol, and microalbuminuria predicted CVD mortality with equal or higher HRs when compared with the MetS. Therefore, our study gives support for the notion that the MetS is a marker of CVD risk, but not above and beyond the risk associated with its individual components.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Definitions of the MetS by the WHO, EGIR, NCEP, ACE, IDF, and updated NCEP criteria</figDesc><table><row><cell>Required</cell><cell>WHO Fasting insulin in top 25%; fasting glucose 6.1 mmol/L; 2 h glucose 7.8 and 2 of:</cell><cell>EGIR Fasting insulin in top 25% and 2 of:</cell><cell>NCEP -3 of:</cell><cell>ACE High risk of being insulin resistant a and 2 of:</cell><cell>IDF For Europeans: Waist 94 cm in men or 80 cm in women and 2 of:</cell><cell>Updated NCEP -3 of:</cell><cell>The metabolic syndrome predicts cardiovascular mortality</cell></row><row><cell>Fasting glucose</cell><cell></cell><cell>6.1 mmol/L</cell><cell>6.1 mmol/L</cell><cell>6.1 mmol/L</cell><cell>5.6 mmol/L</cell><cell>5.6 mmol/L</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>HDL cholesterol</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>,1.03 mmol/L (men) or</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>,1.29 mmol/L</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>(women)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>or</cell><cell>or</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Triglycerides</cell><cell>1.7 mmol/L</cell><cell>.2.0 mmol/L</cell><cell>1.7 mmol/L</cell><cell>1.7 mmol/L</cell><cell>1.7 mmol/L</cell><cell>1.7 mmol/L</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Obesity</cell><cell>Waist/hip ratio .0.90 in men</cell><cell>Waist 94 cm in men</cell><cell>Waist 102 cm in men</cell><cell></cell><cell>Waist 94 cm in men</cell><cell>Waist 102 cm in men</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>or .0.85 in women; BMI</cell><cell>or 80 cm in</cell><cell>or 88 cm in women</cell><cell></cell><cell>or 80 cm in women</cell><cell>or 88 cm in women</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>30 kg/m 2</cell><cell>women</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>(for Europeans)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Hypertension</cell><cell>140/90 mmHg or drug</cell><cell>140/90 mmHg or</cell><cell>130/85 mmHg or drug</cell><cell>130/85 mmHg or</cell><cell>130/85 mmHg or drug</cell><cell>130/85 mmHg or drug</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>treatment</cell><cell>drug treatment</cell><cell>treatment</cell><cell>drug treatment</cell><cell>treatment</cell><cell>treatment</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Microalbuminuria</cell><cell>Urinary albumin/urinary</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>creatinine ratio 3.39 mg/</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>mmol (30 mg/g)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">a In this study 2 h plasma glucose from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L.</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note>,0.9 mmol/L in men or ,1.0 mmol/L in women,1.0 mmol/L ,1.03 mmol/L in men or ,1.29 mmol/L in women ,1.03 mmol/L (men) or ,1.29 mmol/L (women) ,1.03 mmol/L (men) or ,1.29 mmol/L (women)</note></figure>
