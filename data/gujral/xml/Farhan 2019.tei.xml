<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of pre-diabetes (pre-DM) on coronary plaque characteristics and ischemic outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). BACKGROUND Pre-DM (i.e., the early stages of glucometabolic disturbance) is common among patients with ACS, but the extent to which pre-DM influences coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for adverse ischemic events is unclear. METHODS In the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in Coronary Tree) study, patients with ACS underwent quantitative coronary angiography, grayscale intravascular ultrasound, and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their glucometabolic status, as defined by the American Diabetes Association: normal glucose metabolism (NGM), pre-DM, and diabetes mellitus (DM). These groups were compared with regard to coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (defined as cardiac death or arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina). RESULTS Among 547 patients, 162 (29.6%) had NGM, 202 (36.9%) had pre-DM, and 183 (33.4%) had DM. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to intravascular ultrasound findings indicative of vulnerable plaques. Patients with DM had a higher crude rate of MACEs than those with pre-DM or NGM (25.9% vs. 16.3% and 16.1%; p ¼ 0.03 and p ¼ 0.02, respectively). In an adjusted Cox regression model using NGM as the reference group, DM (hazard ratio: 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 3.86; p ¼ 0.006) but not pre-DM (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 2.33; p ¼ 0.41) was associated with increased risk for MACEs.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS Impaired glucose metabolism is common among patients presenting with ACS. DM but not pre-DM is associated with an increased risk for MACEs. Thus, preventing patients from progressing from pre-DM to DM is important.

The PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in Coronary Tree) study investigated the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis in a population of patients admitted for ACS and treated successfully with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(7)</ref>. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of early stages of glucometabolic disturbance on morphologic features of coronary atherosclerotic lesions and the risk for 3-year ischemic events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS STUDY POPULATION.</head><p>PROSPECT was conducted at 37 centers in the United States and Europe. The study design and main results have been published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(7)</ref>. In brief, 697 patients with ACS who were treated successfully with PCI for all lesions deemed responsible for the index event were enrolled. All included patients underwent angiography as well as grayscale and intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) (Volcano Corporation, San Diego, California) of the left main coronary artery as well as 6 to 8 cm of the proximal portion of each major epicardial coronary vessel.</p><p>In the present analysis, patients were divided according to their glucometabolic status into those with normal glucose metabolism (NGM), pre-DM, and DM on the basis of recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(8)</ref>. DM was defined as a history of DM or ongoing treatment with glucoselowering medication or dietary control and/or fasting glucose $126 mg/dl and/or glycated hemoglobin $6.5%. Pre-DM was defined as fasting glucose $100 and &lt;126 mg/dl and/or glycated hemoglobin $5.7% in patients who did not meet any of the criteria for DM.</p><p>NGM was defined as fasting glucose &lt;100 mg/dl and/or glycated hemoglobin &lt;5.7% and the absence of all criteria for DM. All laboratory measurements were performed while fasting during the hospitalization for the index procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(9)</ref>.</p><p>GRAYSCALE IVUS AND IVUS-VH. Grayscale IVUS and IVUS-VH analyses were performed using QCU-CMS (Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, the Netherlands). pcVH 2.1 (Volcano Corporation) was used for contouring and data output, and proprietary software (qVH, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York) was used for segmental quantitative and qualitative analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11)</ref>. The external elastic membrane (EEM) and lumen borders were detected at approximately every 0.4-mm interval (depending on heart rate) and used to determine the EEM cross-sectional area (CSA), lumen CSA, and plaque plus media CSA and burden (defined as 100 Â [plaque þ media]/EEM CSA). A nonculprit lesion was defined as $3 consecutive frames with plaque burden $40%. IVUS-VH allows the characterization of 4 different plaque components (red corresponds to necrotic core, green to fibrous tissue, light green to fibrofatty, and white to dense calcium). On the basis of its compositional traits, each lesion was classified as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), thick-cap fibroatheroma, pathological intimal thickening, fibrotic plaque, or fibrocalcific plaque <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12)</ref>. All IVUS frames were coregistered to the angiographic roadmap using fiduciary side branches for alignment.</p><p>CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), defined as cardiac death or arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina.

On the basis of follow-up angiography, recurrent MACEs were adjudicated as occurring at initially treated (culprit) or previously untreated (nonculprit) lesions. On the basis of principal results <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(7)</ref>, a high-risk lesion was defined as having 2 or more of the following: plaque burden $70%, minimum luminal area (MLA) #4.0 mm 2 , or TCFA. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Baseline clinical and imaging data were stratified on the basis of glucometabolic status. Categorical variables are expressed as percentages and were compared using the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables are reported as median (interquartile range) and were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Outcomes are reported as Kaplan-Meier percentages and numbers of events and were compared using log-rank tests. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex was used to estimate the relationship between pre-DM and DM with risk for having IVUS features of high-risk plaque (MLA #4 mm 2 , TCFA, and plaque burden $70%). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the adjusted risk for 3-year MACEs associated with glucometabolic status. Both DM and pre-DM were entered into this multivariate model, with NGM as the  3-YEAR OUTCOMES.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impaired Glucose Tolerance in ACS</head><p>A P R I L 2 0 1 9 : 7 3 3 -4 1 with DM had significantly higher rates of MACEs than those with pre-DM and NGM (25.9% vs. 16.3% vs.</p><p>16.1%, respectively; p ¼ 0.03), which was attributed mainly to a higher rate of revascularization in patients with DM (21.9% vs. 13.6% vs. 12.1%; p ¼ 0.03) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). When events were broken down into those occurring in culprit versus nonculprit vessels, patients with DM had numerically higher rates of both culprit-and non-culprit-related MACEs than patients with pre-DM and NGM, but these differences were not statistically significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, Figures <ref type="figure">1B and 1C</ref>). In 13 patients (2.4%), no coronary angiography at the time of the event was performed.</p><p>Those events were classified as indeterminate (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). In an adjusted Cox regression analysis using NGM as the reference group, DM but not pre-DM was predictive of overall as well as culprit lesion MACEs (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, Supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). There was no statistically significant interaction between DM status and any of the high-risk plaque characteristics with regard to MACEs (p interaction &gt; 0.10 for all).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The main findings of the present analysis of the PROSPECT study are that: 1) the prevalence of DM and pre-DM is high among patients admitted for ACS when ADA criteria are applied; and 2) DM but not pre-DM was an independent predictor of MACEs, although patients with neither DM nor pre-DM had more severe CAD than patients with NGM, as detected by indexes of plaque morphology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recent treatment advancements for patients with</head><p>CAD have been less effective in patients with versus without DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(13)</ref>. This is concerning, because the prevalence of DM continues to increase and currently constitutes a growing threat to public health <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(13)</ref>.

In contrast, the risk for patients with pre-DM was similar to that of patients with NGM. This may seem surprising, but it is consistent Thus, compared with patients with DM in other studies, patients with DM in PROSEPCT likely had less severe and less long-standing hyperglycemia at the time of coronary assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(9)</ref>. We prospectively  studied nonculprit lesions after successful PCI, whereas the other studies focused on culprit lesions. It is possible that the association between DM and highrisk plaque characteristics that has been described for culprit lesions is less pronounced in nonculprit lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">26)</ref>. Notably, only the proximal 6 to 8 cm of each major epicardial coronary artery was evaluated in the PROSPECT study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(7)</ref>. Necropsy studies have shown that DM affects predominantly distal portions of coronary arteries <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(27)</ref>, which could explain the apparent lack of differences in high-risk plaque features.</p><p>Microvascular dysfunction, which is prevalent among patients with DM, may have contributed to the increased risk for MACE among patients with DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(28)</ref>.</p><p>Last, the diagnostic criteria used to detect pre-DM and latent DM were different in our study than in the other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(29)</ref>. It is possible that stratification of patients into NGM, pre-DM, and DM groups, as per the ADA guidelines, is not the most efficient means of predicting the presence of high-risk plaque characteristics. In fact, a previous publication from PROSPECT that focused on established DM and metabolic syndrome rather than pre-DM showed that patients with neither DM nor metabolic syndrome had the most favorable plaque characteristics, although these differences were small in magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(30)</ref>. The differences between the present analysis and that of Marso et al. Given the fact that most patients in the DM group had non-insulin-dependent DM, our findings are consistent with previous observations that primary preventive measures appear to be more effective in patients with non-insulin-dependent versus insulindependent DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(31)</ref>. Thus, even among patients who have progressed to non-insulin-treated DM, appropriate glucometabolic control and other therapeutic measures may prevent progression of CAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">33)</ref>. This hypothesis should be tested in clinical trials specifically designed for patients with pre-DM or newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent DM.</p><p>STUDY LIMITATIONS. This study had several limitations. First, this was a post hoc analysis of a prospective study, and our results should be considered hypothesis generating rather than confirmatory.</p><p>Second, plasma glucose concentrations may be increased in ACS, which increases the risk of inadvertently classifying patients with NGM as having pre-DM or DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(34)</ref>; however, the GAMI (Glucose Tolerance in Acute Myocardial Infarction) study, which enrolled patients with acute myocardial infarction, showed that results were similar when glucose tolerance was estimated during the index hospitalization or 3 months later <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(35)</ref>.  </p></div>

In fact, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of DM duration<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17)</ref> and cumulative hyperglycemic insults<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19)</ref> among patients with long-standing DM on the risk for adverse ischemic events. Hence, pre-DM may represent a stage at which few of the end-organ effects of hyperglycemia, including effects on the coronary arterial tree, have occurred. Our findings support this hypothesis.That being said, whether early stages of glucometabolic impairment affect coronary plaque morphology is still a matter of debate. Hyperglycemia and resistance promote the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and angiotensin). This leads to a proinflammatory state with accelerated atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction (20-22). Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia and daily glucose fluctuations have been associated with coronary plaque vulnerability (22,23). Amano et al. (5) investigated coronary culprit lesions of patients with CAD and found higher plaque volume and lipid content in patients with DM as well as in those with early stages of glucose abnormalities. Similarly, Kurihara et al. (6) showed a higher degree of yellow vulnerable plaque in patients with pre-DM and DM using coronary angioscopy. It may therefore seem surprising that we found no differences in the prevalence of high-risk plaque characteristics between any of the study groups. The reason for the discrepant findings between our investigation and previous studies could be explained by the difference in study design and the investigated population. Only a minority of the patients in PROSPECT had insulintreated DM, and patients with insulin-treated DM have been shown to have considerably more extensive CAD than patients with non-insulin-treated DM (24).</figDesc></figure>

First, given the high incidence of pre-DM and DM observed in this study, patients who present with ACS should be carefully screened for DM.Second, the lack of a clear association between pre-DM and MACEs should encourage patients and clinicians to devote the necessary efforts to prevent these patients from progressing to DM. Furthermore, the lack of a clear association between pre-DM, as well as DM, and high-risk plaque characteristics is encouraging.</figDesc></figure>

DM but not pre-DM was associated with increased risk for MACEs despite the absence of significant differences in IVUS indexes of coronary morphology. Patients with ACS should be systematically screened for pre-DM and DM.
