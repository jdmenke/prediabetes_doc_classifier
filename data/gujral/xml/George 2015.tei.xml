<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Design and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient cohort</head><p>After the GAMI study <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and according to guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> all patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus admitted to our unit with a confirmed MI underwent pre-discharge OGTT as part of routine clinical care. This observational study includes all consecutive patients admitted to our unit between November 2005 and October 2008 who underwent OGTT and were prospectively followed up. Data on demographics, risk factors for CAD, history of confirmed CAD, pre-hospital and discharge medications, troponin I levels, and revascularisation status of every patient was prospectively entered into a local database for contribution to the Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project. Patients who died before the OGTT, were admitted under the surgeons, transferred to another centre for urgent revascularisation or did not tolerate the glucose drink for the OGTT were excluded. Mortality data was collected from the hospital care records for patients who died in hospital. For patients who died in the community, mortality data was obtained from the general practitioner medical records and confirmed by the data provided by the office of public health intelligence. As this study retrospectively reported on routinely collected anonymised data on standard clinical practice to contribute to a National Audit database, the East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire Research Ethics Committee confirmed that formal patient consent and ethical approval was not required. We registered this study as an audit with the Local Audit and Clinical Governance Department.</p><p>On or after the third day of admission, venous plasma glucose was measured after an overnight fast of 8 hours (FPG). A standardised OGTT (venous plasma glucose measured 2 hours after administration of 75g glucose (2-h PG) in 200 ml water) was performed on the same day. Plasma glucose was enzymatically determined using the glucose oxidase method. Intravenous glucose solutions were not allowed, but anti-adrenergic agents were used if clinically indicated. Patients, who were clinically too unstable for the test on day 3, were tested later during that admission. All patients diagnosed with IGT and NDM were advised lifestyle modification including diet, physical activity and referred to the diabetologists for appropriate management that was overseen by them as out-patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions</head><p>MI was diagnosed according to the universal definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. A smoker was a person currently smoking or had stopped for &lt;2 years, hypertensive if treated for or newly diagnosed with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemic if total cholesterol &gt;5 mmol/l or treated for it. History of CAD included a history of confirmed MI and/ or PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting. The glucometabolic state was classified as follows: normal glucose tolerance (NGT): FPG &lt;6.1 mmol/l and a 2-h PG &lt;7.8 mmol/l; imapired fasting glucose (IFG): FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l and 2-h PG &lt;7.8 mmol/l; IGT: FPG &lt;7 mmol/l and 2-h PG 7.8-11 mmol/l. NDM: FPG 7.0 and/ or 2-h PG 11.1 mmol/l. AGT was defined as patients with IGT or NDM. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus prior to the index admission were excluded. Patients were classified as having diabetes on the basis of history, regardless of duration of disease or need for anti-diabetic agents. The diagnosis was established if the patient had been informed of the diagnosis by a physician before the admission or was taking oral hypoglycaemic agents, insulin, or receiving dietary therapy. Although current guidelines supports the use of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in diagnosing diabetes, for the purpose of this study it was not incorporated into the methodology since it was not recommended in contemporary guidance and was not available for routine use at our center at the time of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome measures</head><p>All participants were followed up for a median of 48 months for outcomes. Follow-up data was complete for all patients. Completeness of follow up was ensured by manual review of hospital and general practice records. Importantly each event was recorded at the first occurrence only. Cardiovascular death was defined as death from myocardial infarction, heart failure, nonhaemorrhagic stroke and sudden death without any obvious reason. A non-fatal re-infarction was defined as a non-fatal MI occurring later than 72 h after the index infarction. Stroke was defined as a neurological deficit persisting &gt;24 hours as observed by a physician with radiological confirmation of haemorrhagic or non-haemorrhagic stroke. Severe heart failure (HF) was recognised when causing hospital admission requiring intensification of or additional treatment. The primary end-point was a composite outcome defined as the first occurrence of a MACE including cardiovascular death, non-fatal re-infarction, severe heart failure or nonhaemorrhagic stroke. Secondary end-points were all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal re-infarctions, severe heart failure or stroke.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Continuous variables are presented as medians (inter-quartile range) and categorical variables as counts and proportions (%). Differences in baseline characteristics between the three groups were compared using the one-way analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis test for parametric and non-parametric data respectively for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables. Event free survival was estimated in the three glucometabolic categories from Kaplan-Meier curves that were compared using the Log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling was used to analyse the effect of several variables on event free survival. All covariates known to affect prognosis after MI including age, gender, smoking status, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, history of previous acute myocardial infarction, diagnosis at discharge, discharge prescription of aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins, revascularisation status and glucometabolic status were "entered" into the model. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for events in each glucometabolic categories after adjustment for all the other clinical characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p>About 90% of the 1489 index admissions with raised troponin between November 2005 and October 2008 had a diagnosis of MI confirmed. Patients previously known to have diabetes (n = 289) were excluded. The baseline characteristics of 768 patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus with MI who had the OGTT are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Patients with IGT and NDM were older but all other clinical characteristics were similar in the 3 groups. OGTT was done </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarises all first events during 47.2 ± 9.4 months of follow up. A total of 224 events (102 deaths from all causes, 95 non fatal myocardial infarctions, 18 heart failure admissions and 9 non haemorrhagic strokes) occurred during follow up. Of the 102 deaths from all causes 32 (9.5%) with NGT, 44 (15.8%) with IGT and 26 (17.1%) with NDM), 79 occurred as the first event. A further 23 deaths occurred during follow up of patients who reached a non-fatal endpoint. Of these 13 were cardiovascular deaths (3 in NGT, 8 in IGT and 2 in NDM groups), 4 cancer, 3 sepsis, 2 haemorrhagic strokes and 1 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Of the 33 non-cardiovascular deaths that that occurred as first event, 13 were due to cancer, 6 haemorrhagic stroke, 7 pneumonia, 3 sepsis, 2 acute renal failure, 1 gastrointestinal bleed and 1 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>The incidence of adverse events progressively increased from the NGT to the NDM group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Event-free survival was significantly different in the three groups (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). After adjustment for covariates using Cox proportional hazard modeling (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), NDM and IGT were strong independent predictors of survival free of the primary end-point. NDM also independently predicted all cause mortality (HR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.17-3.94; p = 0.0145), cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.83, 95% CI: 1.24-6.45; p = 0.0135), non-fatal MI (HR 1.96, 95% CI: 1.16-3.29; p = 0.0121) and combined cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI (HR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.39-3.38; p = 0.0007). Absence of AGT predicted reduced cardiovascular deaths (HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.91; p = 0.0257), combined cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI (HR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.90; p = 0.0125) and combined cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI or heart failure (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.43-0.87; p = 0.0069). The adjusted ORs for MACE were significantly higher in the IGT, NDM and AGT groups. The odds of the secondary end-points increased with NDM and AGT but not IGT (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Log-likelihood ratio tests were used to compare the fit of predictive models using categories based on FPG and OGTT only and in combination (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Comparing nested models showed that including the OGTT categories significantly improved the predictability of the model based on FPG categories and above noted risk factors, for MACE (χ2 = 26.41, df = 3, p = 0.00), cardiovascular death (χ2 = 9.1, df = 3, p = 0.03), non-fatal MI (χ2 = 11.75, df = 3, p = 0.01) and combined end-point of cardiovascular deaths and non-fatal MI (χ2 = 19.18, df = 3, p = 0.00). In contrast, the addition of categories based on FPG only to the model based on OGTT categories and risk factors did not significantly improve the prediction of the model for MACE (χ2 = 0.44, df = 2, p = 0.80), cardiovascular deaths (χ2 = 0.59, df = 2, p = 0.74), nonfatal MI (χ2 = 0.08, df = 2, p = 0.96) and combined end-point of cardiovascular deaths and non-fatal MI (χ2 = 0.13, df = 2, p = 0.94).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our study confirms that (1) a large proportion of patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus admitted with MI have new DM and IGT that would remain undiagnosed on FPG only, (2) the incidence of MACE after MI progressively increases from the patients with NGT to NDM, (3) MACE-free survival in these patients is worse not only with NDM but also with IGT and (4) both NDM and IGT are strong predictors of MACE.</p><p>It is well recognized that the vascular risk associated with glucometabolic disorders appear early in the course of the disease spectrum, and years ahead of the development of diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The high prevalence rate of IGT in our study is in keeping with this and suggests that risk of MI extends to patients with pre-diabetic conditions as well. This is by far the largest study assessing the effect of newly diagnosed AGT on prognosis after MI. Most previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> recruited fewer patients before the widespread use of statins, clopidogrel and drug eluting stents. The effect of IGT on prognosis remained unclear in previous studies. Although both the GAMI group <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and Tamita et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> suggest the independent effect of AGT on MACE, neither study report the adjusted hazard of MACE in patients with IGT and NDM separately. Thus it is unclear whether IGT affected prognosis in these studies. Kitada et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> reported similar MACE rates in the NGT and IGT groups with higher MACE rates in NDM. MACE predominantly consisted of revascularisation for restenosis and de novo lesions with very few cardiovascular events. Euro Heart Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> reported prognosis in 2515 non-diabetic patients with CAD, included 1029 with MI classified based on OGTT. Within the whole population, NDM but not IGT independently increased the risk of death but not the other end-points. As MACE in the MI patients has not been published separately, it is impossible to infer the prognostic effect of the glucometabolic states in these patients from this study. Our study clearly demonstrates that not only NDM but also IGT independently adversely affects prognosis after MI. This study confirms previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> that FPG alone underestimates the prevalence of abnormal glucometabolic state. About 90% of our patients were diagnosed normal by FPG only and 84% of patients with AGT had normal FPG. In the DECODE study, about 37% of NDM diagnosed on OGTT were normal on FPG criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In the GAMI population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, 10% had NDM on FPG criteria compared to 31% on OGTT criteria. The reliability of pre-discharge OGTT in reflecting "true" glucometabolic state may be dependent on its timing in relation to the cardiac event and the severity of the event itself. The pre-discharge glucometabolic category may <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> or may not <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> change in the medium to long term in these patients. Glucometabolic categories based on OGTT done within 24 hours of a STEMI changed in 46% patients at 3 months post-discharge <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Glucometabolic abnormality seems to be overestimated within the first 24 hours after STEMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. However, OGTT done at or after 5 days seems to reliably predict long term glucometabolic state <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. This may be related to the subsidence of the acute responses between 2-5 days with no further decrease thereafter <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Hage et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> suggested a somewhat better reproducibility of OGTT in patients with subendocardial than transmural infarction. All our patients had the OGTT at least three days (37% day 4) after the index event. This makes it likely that the results would reliably predict long term glucometabolic state. Irrespective of its relation to long term glucometabolic status, pre-charge OGTT based classification independently predicted prognosis in our post-MI patients.</p><p>While the measurement of HbA1c would have improved the understanding of the glucometabolic status of these patients, especially with regard to the role of stress induced hyperglycaemia in the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance; this was not available for use at our center on a routine basis. Furthermore, while HbA1c identifies patients with NDM, it has limited use in the identification of patients with intermediate hyperglycaemia or IGT. Recent studies have shown an increased incidence of adverse events in non-diabetic post MI patients with elevated HbA1c, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is not entirely a stress mediated response <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Furthermore, the purpose of the study was to ascertain the prognostic risk of post challenge hyperglycaemia in patients following acute MI, irrespective of the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p>There are some differences in baseline characteristics across the three groups, which could have influenced the results. Patients with IGT and NDM were older than the patients in NGT group, which was noted to be statistically significant. Although we have adjusted for this in the cox proportional hazard regression model and while it is unlikely to explain the increased incidence of adverse events in the IGT and NDM group; it is difficult to be certain if there any residual confounding in the final result. Similar baseline variation, especially in age, between NGT and AGT has been noted in other similar studies as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>The MACE rates in our study are similar to those previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Contrary to some <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, our study suggests that clinical events rather non-target vessel revascularisation may predominate MACE in post-MI patients newly diagnosed with IGT or DM. The management of our patients matched contemporary published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The revascularisation rate was similar to the GRACE registry <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Compared to the EHS-ACS II survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, PCI rates were lower in STEMI, as most patients were thrombolysed, but similar in NSTEMI patients.</p><p>In the absence of robust evidence for prognostic, benefits of intensive glycaemic control <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, none of our patients underwent in-hospital intensive glucose lowering therapy. They were not discharged on hypoglycaemic agents due to the uncertainty whether the dysglycaemia detected pre-discharge truly reflected the "true" glucometabolic status. All IGT and NDM patients were advised lifestyle modification including diet, physical activity and were referred to the cardiac rehabilitation service. They were also referred to the diabetologists for appropriate management that was overseen by them as out-patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Being an observational longitudinal cohort study using retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a single centre, it has its limitations. In line with all other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we did not explore the interaction between either acute revascularisation and post-challenge hyperglycaemia or post-discharge management of the glucometabolic status and prognosis. As OGTT was not repeated pre-or post-discharge, it is uncertain whether random fluctuation in glycaemia or stress associated hyperglycaemia affected results. However, as pre-discharge postchallenge hyperglycaemia, irrespective of its pathophysiological mechanism, diagnosed on these measurements predicted outcomes in post-MI patients, the reproducibility of these measurements and its relation to long term glucometabolic status may be less relevant when assessing prognostic risk. Though we could not include a small proportion of non-diabetic post-MI patients admitted to our institution who could not have OGTT for valid reasons, we feel that it would be acceptable to extend the results of this study to the whole population.</p><p>In summary, our study suggests for the first time that risk of MACE after an MI is increased not only in newly diagnosed DM but also in IGT. It provides further evidence to support the previous finding that dysglycaemia is common post MI in patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus. Importantly as the glucometabolic status of a large proportion of patients would be misdiagnosed on FPG only, an appropriately timed OGTT after MI, may be helpful in assessing prognostic risk and plan future management.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Clinical characteristics of the study population. in 63.3% patients, day 4-7 in 33.3% and rest later. Patients who had their OGTT on day 3 had similar FPG (5.28 ± 0.75 v 5.20 ± 0.89, p = 0.17) and 2h-PG (8.75 ± 3.07 v 8.76 ± 3.14, p = 0.99) to those done later. About 63% of STEMI and 64% of NSTEMI patients had OGTT done on day three. The OGTT was done later in admission in STEMI than in NSTEMI patients (4.07±1.67 days v 3.82±1.37 days, p = 0.02). FPG (5.32 ± 0.80 v 5.21 ± 0.81, p = 0.06) and 2h-PG (8.76 ± 3.08 v 8.76 ± 3.11, p = 0.99) were similar in patients with NSTEMI and STEMI respectively. About 76% of patients presenting with STEMI were thrombolysed of which about 23% needed rescue PCI. Another 2% had PPCI. The rest were ineligible for thrombolysis and were not reperfused. Of the STEMI patients that did not undergo revascularisation acutely, 29% had ischaemia driven revascularisation (PCI in 72%). All patients with NSTEMI had coronary angiogram and 41% were revascularised (92% had PCI). Overall 42% of patients were revascularised (PCI 37%, CABG 5%). About 36% and 7% patients with STEMI and 38% and 3% with NSTEMI underwent PCI and CABG respectively.FPG categorised 689 (89.7%) patients as NGT, 48 (6.3%) as IFG and 31 (4.0%) as NDM. After OGTT, 328 (42.7%) patients had NGT, 9(1.2%) had IFG, 279 (36.3%) had IGT and 152 (19.8%) were NDM. As the 9 IFG patients by definition did not have post-load hyperglycaemia, they were included in the NGT group for purposes of the analysis. Of the 689 patients diagnosed normal on FPG alone, 261 (37.9%) had IGT and 100 (14.5%) had NDM. Of the 48 patients diagnosed IFG on FPG alone, 17 (37.4%) had IGT and 22 (45.8%) had NDM. Of the 431 (56.1%) patients with post-load hyperglycaemia, 361 (83.8%) had normal FPG.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>NGT(n = 337)</cell><cell>IGT(n = 279)</cell><cell>NDM(n = 152)</cell><cell>p</cell></row><row><cell>Age (years; median; IQR)</cell><cell>62(17)</cell><cell>68(18)</cell><cell>68(19)</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell></row><row><cell>Male n (%)</cell><cell>236(70)</cell><cell>204(73)</cell><cell>109(72)</cell><cell>0.70</cell></row><row><cell>Current smoker</cell><cell>101(30.0)</cell><cell>96(34.4)</cell><cell>46(30.3)</cell><cell>0.46</cell></row><row><cell>Hypertension</cell><cell>122(36.2)</cell><cell>117(41.9)</cell><cell>59(38.8)</cell><cell>0.35</cell></row><row><cell>Hypercholesterolaemia</cell><cell>151(44.8)</cell><cell>134(48.0)</cell><cell>67(44.1)</cell><cell>0.65</cell></row><row><cell>Previous myocardial infarction</cell><cell>51(15.1)</cell><cell>59(21.1)</cell><cell>29(19.1)</cell><cell>0.15</cell></row><row><cell>Known IHD</cell><cell>85(25.2)</cell><cell>89(31.9)</cell><cell>50(32.9)</cell><cell>0.10</cell></row><row><cell>Family history</cell><cell>138(40.9)</cell><cell>115(41.2)</cell><cell>65(42.8)</cell><cell>0.93</cell></row><row><cell>Discharge diagnosis of NSTEMI</cell><cell>196(58.2)</cell><cell>159(57.0)</cell><cell>92(60.5)</cell><cell>0.78</cell></row><row><cell>Discharge medications</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Aspirin</cell><cell>308(91.4)</cell><cell>255(91.4)</cell><cell>142(93.4)</cell><cell>0.72</cell></row><row><cell>Clopidogrel</cell><cell>280(83.1)</cell><cell>222(79.6)</cell><cell>129(84.9)</cell><cell>0.33</cell></row><row><cell>Dual anti-platelet</cell><cell>265(78.6)</cell><cell>207(74.2)</cell><cell>121(79.6)</cell><cell>0.31</cell></row><row><cell>Beta-blocker</cell><cell>260(77.2)</cell><cell>211(75.6)</cell><cell>116(76.3)</cell><cell>0.90</cell></row><row><cell>ACEI/ARB</cell><cell>270(80.1)</cell><cell>236(84.6)</cell><cell>128(84.2)</cell><cell>0.29</cell></row><row><cell>Statin</cell><cell>325(96.4)</cell><cell>264(94.6)</cell><cell>142(93.4)</cell><cell>0.30</cell></row><row><cell>Revascularised</cell><cell>147(43.6)</cell><cell>118(42.3)</cell><cell>58(38.2)</cell><cell>0.52</cell></row><row><cell>Troponin I (μg/l; median; IQR)</cell><cell>2.8(13.2)</cell><cell>3.2(11.0)</cell><cell>3.0(15.5)</cell><cell>0.82</cell></row><row><cell>FBG (mmol/l; median; IQR)</cell><cell>4.9(0.5)</cell><cell>5.1(0.8)</cell><cell>5.7(1.3)</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell></row><row><cell>2HBG (mmol/l; median; IQR)</cell><cell>6.3(1.6)</cell><cell>9.2(1.9)</cell><cell>12.9(2.7)</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell></row></table><note>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0142045.t001 on day 3</note></figure>
