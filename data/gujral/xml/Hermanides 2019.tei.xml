<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Long-term clinical outcome is less well known in up to presentation persons unknown with diabetes mellitus who present with acute myocardial infarction and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels on admission. We aimed to study the prognostic impact of deranged HbA1c at presentation on long-term mortality in patients not known with diabetes, presenting with acute myocardial infarction. Methods: A single-centre, large, prospective observational study in patients with and without known diabetes admitted to our hospital for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI. Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus was defined as HbA1c of 48 mmol/l or greater and pre-diabetes mellitus was defined as HbA1c between 39 and 47 mmol/l. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at short (30 days) and long-term (median 52 months) follow-up. Results: Out of 7900 acute myocardial infarction patients studied, 1314 patients (17%) were known diabetes patients. Of the 6586 patients without known diabetes, 3977 (60%) had no diabetes, 2259 (34%) had pre-diabetes and 350 (5%) had newly diagnosed diabetes based on HbA1c on admission. Both short-term (3.9% vs. 7.4% vs. 6.0%, p&lt;0.001) and long-term mortality (19% vs. 26% vs. 35%, p&lt;0.001) for both pre-diabetes patients as well as newly diagnosed diabetes patients was poor and comparable to known diabetes patients. After multivariate analysis, newly diagnosed diabetes was independently associated with long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.34, P=0.001). Conclusions: In the largest study to date, newly diagnosed or pre-diabetes was present in 33% of acute myocardial infarction patients and was associated with poor long-term clinical outcome. Newly diagnosed diabetes (HbA1c ⩾48 mmol/mol) is an independent predictor of long-term mortality. More attention to early detection of diabetic status and initiation of blood glucose-lowering treatment is necessary.</p></div>

Furthermore, we want to create awareness among cardiologists to look critically at HbA1c in STEMI and NSTEMI patients when presenting and if necessary to diagnose and treat DM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and population</head><p>We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a prospective observational study in an all-comer STEMI and NSTEMI population.</p><p>All consecutive patients admitted with STEMI and NSTEMI in Isala (Zwolle, The Netherlands) between January 2006 and January 2015 were included. During this timeframe, HbA1c was routinely measured directly on admission in all STEMI and NSTEMI patients. In order to maintain a uniform patient population with STEMI and NSTEMI, specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. NSTEMI was defined as acute chest pain or a dyspnoae equivalent, in combination with a rise or fall in cardiac troponin/creatine kinase (CK)/CK-MB compatible with myocardial infarction (MI), and/or dynamic ST or T-wave changes.</p><p>Furthermore, NSTEMI patients were only included if the NSTEMI was causes by acute atherothrombotic coronary artery disease and usually precipitated by atherosclerotic plaque disruption (rupture or erosion). Furthermore, only patients who presented after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or in-hospital cardiac arrest were excluded, as prognosis in these patients is primarily driven by neurological outcome. There were no further exclusion criteria with regard to age, gender, ischaemic time, cardiac history or renal function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>Patient characteristics were acquired on admission using either case record forms or using a computer-based database. Clinical follow-up was performed by telephone contact (with either the general practitioner or with direct contact with patients) or through coupling of municipal mortality records. Follow-up was performed by independent research nurses not involved in patient treatment, as has been standard practice in our department for many years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> Ten patients (10/7900=0.001%) were lost to follow-up for long-term all-cause mortality. A total of 568 patients (568/7900=7.2%) were lost to follow-up for one year major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Study approval was obtained from the medical ethics committee of our hospital.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>DM definition by HbA1c was determined by using current ADA guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> Patients without diabetes (no DM) were defined as a HbA1c level at admission of less than 39 mmol/mol (&lt;5.7%). Patients with pre-DM were defined by a HbA1c level on admission of 39-47 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%). Newly diagnosed DM patients were defined by a HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol or greater (⩾6.5%). Known DM patients were defined as known with diabetes on admission, treated either with a diet, with oral glucose-lowering medication and/or with insulin, irrespective of HbA1c.</p><p>Ischaemic time was defined as the time between symptom onset and first balloon inflation. The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) scoring system was used to refer to coronary blood flow assessed during PCI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> Myocardial blush grade (MBG), an angiographic measure of myocardial perfusion, was defined as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> Successful PCI was defined as TIMI 3 flow with MBG 2-3 after PCI. Myocardial infarct size was measured by peak CK level in the first 24 hours after admission. Definition of re-infarction was in accordance with the most recent universal definition of MI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> MACEs were defined as cardiac mortality, re-infarction and target lesion revascularisation.</p><p>HbA1c levels were measured on the Primus Ultra 2 affinity chromatography high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Primus Diagnostics, Kansas City, MO, USA) in Zwolle with a within-run coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 0.5% and Premier Hb9210, affinity chromatography HPLC, IFCC and NGSP certified (Trinity Biotech); and Tosoh G8, cation-exchange HPLC, IFCC certified (Tosoh Bioscience). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> Glucose levels were measured on a modular device (Roche Diagnostics) with venous blood, and with a Radiometer ABL 700/800 series analyser (Radiometer Copenhagen) in whole-blood arterial samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary outcome</head><p>The clinical primary endpoint for our current study was long-term all-cause mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary outcome</head><p>The secondary endpoint for our current study was one-year MACEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Patient groups were created according to DM status and admission HbA1c lower than 39 mmol/mol, 39-47 mmol/ mol and higher than 47 mmol/mol. Continuous data were summarised and are described using median values with the corresponding interquartile range (IQR), or as mean values with corresponding standard deviation (SD), and dichotomous data are given as counts and percentages. Mortality data were compared using either chi-square or log-rank analysis for comparison of Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival curves, where appropriate. Differences between continuous data were non-parametric tested by use of the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the chi-square test was used as appropriate for dichotomous data.</p><p>In multivariate analysis (Cox regression) the association between HbA1c and the primary outcome (longterm all-cause mortality) was adjusted for other (baseline) characteristics, including age, sex, prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or prior MI, smoking, hypertension, renal function, recruitment period (per year), STEMI at admission, Killip class, PCI performed, CABG performed and multivessel disease. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for overall allcause mortality. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows, version 24.0. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient characteristics</head><p>A detailed description of baseline and angiographic characteristics are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>A total number of 7900 patients were included in the present analysis, of which 1314 (17%) had known DM at presentation. Of the 6586 patients without known DM, 3977 (60%) had no DM, 2259 (34%) had pre-DM and 350 (5%) had newly diagnosed DM based on HbA1c concentrations on admission, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Mean HbA1c concentration among patients with pre-DM was 41.7 (±2.2) mmol/mol, 60.6 (±16.0) mmol/mol among patients with newly diagnosed DM and 54.9 (±13.6) mmol/mol among patients with known DM. The glucose level on admission was highest among patients with newly diagnosed DM (12.4±4.8 mmol/l, P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, inflammation levels measured by C-reactive protein on admission were significantly higher in patients with pre-DM, newly diagnosed DM and known DM when compared to no DM patients (14.6 vs. 19.1 vs. 19.9 vs. 11.4 mg/L, P&lt;0.001). Moreover, body mass index levels were significantly higher in patients with pre-DM, newly diagnosed DM and known DM as compared to patients without DM (27.1 vs. 28.8 vs. 28.7 vs. 26.5 kg/m², P&lt;0.001).</p><p>When compared to patients without DM, patients with pre-DM and newly diagnosed DM more often presented with NSTEMI (32.2% vs. 39.3% vs. 44.9%, P&lt;0.001) and significantly more often had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a previous history of MI, PCI or CABG, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Interestingly, pre-DM patients and newly diagnosed DM patients, as well as known DM patients, more often presented with signs of acute heart failure (Killips class 2 or more) on admission (P&lt;0.001).</p><p>Ischaemic time and multivessel disease were significantly higher in pre-DM and newly diagnosed DM patients compared to patients without DM (both P&lt;0.001). There were no differences in TIMI 3 flow post-PCI (P=0.729), successful PCI (P=0.057) or the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (P=0.649) between patients with pre-DM or newly diagnosed DM and patients without DM. With regard to medication at discharge, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was described less often in pre-DM patients and patients with newly diagnosed DM when compared to no DM patients (72.3% vs. 71.6% vs. 76.1%, P&lt;0.001).</p><p>Furthermore, of patients with newly diagnosed DM, 28.1% had oral glucose-lowering medication at discharge, 13.9% of them had insulin at discharge and 34.7% had oral glucoselowering medications and insulin for the treatment of DM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical outcome</head><p>The clinical outcomes are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2 and 3</ref>. Patients without DM significantly more often underwent coronary angiography (P&lt;0.001) and subsequent PCI (P&lt;0.001) and less frequent CABG (P&lt;0.001) or medical therapy (P&lt;0.001) as treatment when compared to the other three groups.</p><p>In the patients who underwent PCI there were no differences in the initial PCI result, although the 30-day and one1-year re-infarction rates were significantly higher in pre-DM, newly diagnosed DM and known DM patients when compared to patients without DM (P&lt;0.001). Oneyear target lesion revascularisation rates were significantly higher in pre-DM, newly diagnosed DM and known DM patients when compared to patients without DM (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, 30-day and one-year MACEs (P&lt;0.001 for both) were significantly higher in pre-DM, newly diagnosed DM and known DM patients when compared to no DM patients. The 30-day and one-year mortality among patients with newly diagnosed DM were 7.4% and 12.6%, respectively. Comparably, 30-day and one-year all-cause mortality rates among patients with known DM were 6.0% and 15.0%, were 3.9% and 8.2% in patients with pre-DM, and were lowest at 2.8% and 5.3% among patients without DM (P&lt;0.001 for both).</p><p>The primary endpoint, long-term all-cause mortality (median 52 months; IQR 26-79 months) was significantly higher in the newly diagnosed DM group (26.3%) and pre-DM group (18.7%) as compared to the no DM group (15%), and was highest in the group with known DM (34.7%) (P&lt;0.001), as is also illustrated by a Kaplan-Meier curve, see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Furthermore, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, a landmark analysis for the primary endpoint was performed for the patients who were discharged alive, which underlined the same finding.</p><p>Using multivariate Cox regression analysis to correct for baseline characteristics, haemodynamic parameters and angiographic characteristics, newly diagnosed DM (HbA1c level ⩾48 mmol/l on admission) was independently associated with long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.34, P=0.001). Significant predictors are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main important findings</head><p>Our study, the largest study to date, demonstrates that 33% of AMI patients have a disorder in long-term glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c (4% newly diagnosed diabetes, 29% pre-diabetes). Moreover, newly diagnosed diabetes is associated with a significantly worse short and long-term prognosis, which interestingly is as poor as in patients with known DM. Of significance, this study highlights that newly diagnosed diabetes is an independent predictor of long-term mortality.</p><p>Recent studies which have evaluated the prognostic value of HbA1c in patients previously unknown with DM hospitalised with ACS have reported discrepant results. In three studies HbA1c did not prove to be an independent predictor of mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> On the other hand, two other studies found that HbA1c was an independent predictor of mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> A systematic review found that HbA1c levels had different prognostic effects based on patients' diabetes status, whereas a U-shaped relationship, with lower mortality among patients within the pre-DM range has been observed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> With regard predicting cardiovascular risk in adults without diabetes, Selvin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> demonstrated improved risk reclassification for coronary heart disease with the inclusion of HbA1c in fully adjusted models, suggesting that HbA1c may be superior to fasting glucose for characterising longterm risk.  Our study represents a large dataset, utilising several years of routine admission HbA1c measurements in all STEMI and NSTEMI patients, and so provides a unique insight into the natural history of glycaemic derangement on long-term mortality in a large group of ACS patients. Our study shows that without routine HbA1c measurement on admission, a significant proportion (33%) of ACS patients with impaired glucose metabolism would go unnoticed, thus missing an opportunity properly to address such derangements through lifestyle adjustments and/or medication. Our findings suggest the need for the adjustment of standard protocols in our hospital and probably many others too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-risk patients</head><p>Newly diagnosed DM and pre-DM patients, as represented by our data, are truly a high ischaemic risk patient population, as manifested by a higher cardiovascular risk profile. They more frequently have a history of previous MI, previous PCI and previous CABG. Furthermore, on coronary angiography, when compared to patients without DM, they significantly more often have multivessel coronary disease.</p><p>Furthermore, in the subset of STEMI patients in our database, patients with newly diagnosed diabetes have a higher prevalance of previous cardiac events, and they present later in the hospital (resulting in a longer total ischaemic time). In a considerable subset of patients with diabetes, clinical signs of MI may present differently with less or even absent pain sensations. This different presentation is ascribed to the presence of neuropathy. Although this might be a possible explanation in newly diagnosed DM as well, this seems less probable, because the development of neuropathy takes years of glycometabolic dysregulation. Such a long-term undetected dysregulation would be quite rare in our opinion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment and recommendation</head><p>With this routine HbA1c measurement on admission in this large AMI cohort we identified 350 patients with newly diagnosed DM. However, only 34.7% of them received any DM medication (oral and/or insulin) at discharge. Adequate treatment in recently diagnosed patients with diabetes is of paramount importance. Svensson et al. recently showed that adequate treatment attaining a strict HbA1c goal of less than 48 mmol/l within 6 months in recently diagnosed DM patients treated with metformin (currently the first oral blood glucose-lowering agent of choice according to the ADA guidelines) was associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, with cardiovascular risk gradually increasing at higher HbA1c levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> So, this population (newly diagnosed DM and pre-DM patients) may need better follow-up and treatment in the post-infarct trajectory of glucose dysregulation which is in accordance with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> Other risk factors such as hypertension and overweight would also need more attention when taking into account the more frequent occurrence of overweight and hypertension in the pre-DM and newly diagnosed DM population. Early identification of high HbA1c concentrations enables the initiation of specific intervention strategies and may help us develop strategies to improve prognosis in these high-risk patient groups. This is of particular importance because there is a global increase in the number of patients with cardiovascular disease with pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed diabetes, underlying insulin resistance and overt diabetes mellitus. Both glucose and HbA1c should be measured routinely in patients admitted with ACS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study was from a single-centre registry and has the intrinsic limitations of a registry.</p><p>A patient already diagnosed with and properly treated for DM could have a lower risk than a patient whose DM status is diagnosed only at the time of hospital admission for NSTEMI or STEMI. We have not been able to make a subdivision into type 1 and type 2 DM in known diabetes patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> Although the current ADA guidelines accept HbA1c as diagnostic criteria, it should be mentioned that the use of HbA1c for the diagnosis of DM is a subject of discussion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> Furthermore, almost 20% of known DM patients did not receive any blood glucose medication at and 65% of the newly diagnosed DM patients did not have blood glucose medication at discharge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In the largest study to date, newly diagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes was present in 33% of AMI patients and both, but mainly newly diagnosed diabetes was associated with poor long-term clinical outcome compared to patients with known diabetes. Newly diagnosed diabetes (HbA1c ⩾48 mmol/mol) is an independent predictor of long-term mortality. More attention to the early detection of present diabetes and the possible start of blood glucose-lowering treatment is necessary.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.
