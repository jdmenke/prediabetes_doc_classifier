BACKGROUND: There are few published data on the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke in American Indians.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
The aims of this observational study were to determine the incidence of stroke and to elucidate stroke risk factors among American Indians.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
METHODS AND RESULTS: This report is based on 4549 participants aged 45 to 74 years at enrollment in the Strong Heart Study the largest longitudinal population-based study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in a diverse group of American Indians.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
At baseline examination in 1989 to 1992 42 participants (age- and sex-adjusted prevalence proportion 1132/100 000 adjusted to the age and sex distribution of the US adult population in 1990) had prevalent stroke.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
Through December 2004 306 (6.8%) of 4507 participants without prior stroke suffered a first stroke at a mean age of 66.5 years.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
The age and sex-adjusted incidence was 679/100 000 person-years.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
Nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction occurred in 86% of participants with incident strokes; 14% had hemorrhagic stroke.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
The overall age-adjusted 30-day case-fatality rate from first stroke was 18% with a 1-year case-fatality rate of 32%.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
"Age diastolic blood pressure fasting glucose hemoglobin A(1c,) smoking albuminuria hypertension prehypertension and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for incident stroke.",Zhang_2008.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with US white and black populations American Indians have a higher incidence of stroke.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
The case-fatality rate for first stroke is also higher in American Indians than in the US white or black population in the same age range.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
Our findings suggest that blood pressure and glucose control and smoking avoidance may be important avenues for stroke prevention in this population.,Zhang_2008.txt,0
BACKGROUND:,Smith_2002.txt,0
The contributions of fasting and 2-hour postchallenge glucose level to cardiovascular events remain ill-defined especially for nondiabetic adults.,Smith_2002.txt,0
This study examined the relative predictive power of fasting and 2-hour glucose level on cardiovascular event risk.,Smith_2002.txt,0
METHODS: A total of 4014 community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who participated in the baseline visit of the Cardiovascular Health Study and who were without treated diabetes or previous myocardial infarction or stroke were eligible for analyses.,Smith_2002.txt,0
Participants with treated diabetes at baseline were excluded.,Smith_2002.txt,0
Incident myocardial infarction or stroke or coronary death was the outcome of interest.,Smith_2002.txt,0
Age- sex- and race adjusted proportional hazards regression models described individual and joint associations between baseline measures of fasting and 2-hour postchallenge glucose level and event risk.,Smith_2002.txt,0
RESULTS:,Smith_2002.txt,0
There were 764 incident cardiovascular events during 8.5 years of follow-up.,Smith_2002.txt,0
Fasting glucose level of 115 mg/dL (6.4 mmol/L) or more was associated with an increased cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-1.98]) in adjusted analyses compared with fasting glucose level less than 115 mg/dL.,Smith_2002.txt,1
Two-hour glucose level was associated with a linear risk (HR 1.02 [95% CI 1.00-1.04] per 10 mg/dL [0.6 mmol/L]) that included an additional increase in risk for 2-hour glucose level of 154 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L) or more (HR 1.29 [95% CI 1.04-1.59]) in adjusted analyses.,Smith_2002.txt,1
In joint fasting and 2-hour glucose models only 2-hour glucose level remained predictive of event risk.,Smith_2002.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Two-hour glucose level was better than fasting glucose level alone at identifying older adults at increased risk of major incident cardiovascular events.,Smith_2002.txt,0
Few prospective studies have examined the combined impact of blood pressure (BP) categories and glucose abnormalities on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general Asian population.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
This study aimed to examine the effect of the combined risks of these factors on the incidence of CVD in a general Japanese population.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
We studied 5321 Japanese individuals (aged 30-79 years) without CVD at baseline who received follow-up for an average of 11.7 years.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Serum fasting glucose categories were defined according to the 2003 American Diabetes Association recommendations.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
BP categories were defined by the 2009 Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
The Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD according to the serum glucose and BP categories were calculated.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
"In 62,036 person-years of follow-up we documented 364 CVD events (198 stroke and 166 coronary heart disease (CHD)).",Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Compared with normoglycemic subjects the multivariable HRs (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for CVD CHD and stroke were 1.25 (1.00-1.58) 1.46 (1.04-2.04) and 1.11 (0.81 1.52) respectively in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) whereas these values were 2.13 (1.50-3.03) 2.28 (1.34-3.88) and 2.08 (1.29-3.35) respectively in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM).,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Compared with normoglycemic and optimal blood pressure (BP) subjects increased risks of CVD were observed in the normoglycemic subjects with high-normal BP or hypertension the IFG subjects with normal or higher BP and the DM subjects regardless of BP category (P-value for interaction=0.046).,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
In conclusion the high-normal BP subjects in all glucose categories and the normal BP subjects with IFG showed increased risk of CVD in this Japanese population.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Further investigation of larger cohorts of DM subjects should be conducted to better understand this phenomenon.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Objective: Recent studies have suggested that prediabetes is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) only among individuals with concomitant hypertension.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Research design and methods:,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
"We analyzed the association between prediabetes and CVD by hypertension status among 3,313 black adults in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) without diabetes or a history of CVD at baseline (2000-2004).",Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL or hemoglobin A 1c between 5.7 and 6.4% (39 and 46 mmol/mol).,Hubbard_2019.txt,1
Hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg and/or self-reported antihypertensive medication use.,Hubbard_2019.txt,1
Participants were followed for incident CVD events and all-cause mortality through 31 December 2014.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Results: Overall 35% of JHS participants did not have prediabetes or hypertension 18% had prediabetes alone 22% had hypertension alone and 25% had both prediabetes and hypertension.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Compared with participants without either condition the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for CVD events among participants with prediabetes alone hypertension alone and both prediabetes and hypertension were 0.86 (95% CI 0.51 1.45) 2.09 (1.39 3.14) and 1.93 (1.28 2.90) respectively.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Among participants with and without hypertension there was no association between prediabetes and an increased risk for CVD (0.78 [0.46 1.34] and 0.94 [0.70 1.26] respectively).,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
No association was present between prediabetes and all-cause mortality among participants with or without hypertension.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Conclusions: Regardless of hypertension status prediabetes was not associated with an increased risk for CVD or all-cause mortality in this cohort of black adults.,Hubbard_2019.txt,1
OBJECTIVE: Although diabetes has a great impact on coronary heart disease (CHD) in Western populations there is limited evidence that diabetes influences CHD in the Japanese population.,Saito_2011.txt,0
"METHODS: The Japan Public Health Center-based prospective (JPHC) study conducted a follow-up of 31,192 individuals aged 40-69 years with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer.",Saito_2011.txt,0
Subjects were classified at baseline as normal borderline diabetic or diabetic based on fasting and non-fasting blood glucose levels and the use of medication to treat diabetes.,Saito_2011.txt,1
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between diabetes and the risk of fatal and non-fatal CHD events after adjustment for potential confounders.,Saito_2011.txt,0
RESULTS: During 12.9 years of follow-up (1990-2006) we identified 266 fatal and non-fatal coronary events using validated criteria.,Saito_2011.txt,0
With normal individuals serving as a control the hazard ratios for total incident CHD events after adjusting for sex age study community and fasting were 1.65 (95% CI 1.19-2.29) and 3.05 (2.03-4.59) in the borderline and diabetic groups respectively.,Saito_2011.txt,0
These associations remained significant after adjustment for conventional risk factors.,Saito_2011.txt,0
The population attributable fractions (PAF) of borderline diabetes and diabetes for CHD events were 6.9% and 6.3% respectively.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Furthermore there was a trend for an association between an impaired fasting glucose (5.6-6.9 mmol/l) and an increased risk of CHD events.,Saito_2011.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS:,Saito_2011.txt,0
This prospective study suggests that diabetes and elevated glucose levels are associated with incident CHD in the general Japanese population.,Saito_2011.txt,0
The PAF of diabetes for fatal and non-fatal coronary events was estimated to be moderate.,Saito_2011.txt,0
OBJECTIVES:,Madssen_2012.txt,0
To assess fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) by gender and glucose regulation status.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
"DESIGN: 47,951 people were followed up according to fatal CAD identified in the National Cause of Death Registry.",Madssen_2012.txt,0
Gender-effects of fatal CAD in people with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) newly diagnosed diabetes (NDM) or known diabetes (KDM) compared with people with normal glucose regulation (NGR) were calculated using Cox regression.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
RESULTS: Using NGR as reference the hazard ratios (HR 95% confidence intervals) associated with IGR was 1.2 (0.8-1.9) for women and 1.2 (0.9-1.6) for men.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
The corresponding HRs were 1.6 (1.2-2.2) and 1.4 (1.1.-1.9) for NDM and 2.5 (2.1-2.8) and 1.8 (1.6-2.1) for KDM.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
The gender difference in mortality varied by category (P(interaction) = 0.003).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Using women as the reference the HRs for men were 2.1 (2.0-2.3) for NGR 1.8 (1.0-3.3) for IGR 1.6 (1.0-2.5) for NDM and 1.2 (1.0-1.5) for KDM. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus but not IGR was associated with fatal CAD in both genders.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
The known gender-difference in CAD mortality was attenuated in people with abnormal glucose regulation evident already in people with IGR.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combinations of blood pressure and glucose tolerance status on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
A total of 7619 participants aged ?30 years old were stratified to nine categories as follows: (1) normotension (NTN) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (reference group) (2) NTN and pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM) (3) NTN and DM (4) pre-hypertension (pre-HTN) and NGT (5) pre-HTN and pre-DM (6) pre-HTN and DM (7) HTN and NGT (8) HTN and pre-DM and (9) HTN and DM.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
Cox proportional hazards were applied to calculate the multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) of different groups for outcomes.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
For all-cause mortality outcomes prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) was also adjusted.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
In a median follow-up of 11.3 years 696 CVD and 412 all-cause mortality events occurred.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Among the population free from CVD at baseline (n=7249) presence of HTN was associated with increased risk of CVD regardless of glucose tolerance status with HRs of 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49-2.61) 2.25 (1.68-3.02) and 3.16 (2.28-4.37) for phenotypes of HTN and NGT HTN and pre-DM and HTN and DM for CVD respectively; corresponding HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.65 (95% CI 1.15-2.37) 1.69 (1.15-2.49) and 2.73 (1.80-4.14) respectively.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
Phenotypes of NTN and pre-DM (1.48; 1.03-2.14) and NTN and DM (2.04; 1.06-3.92) were also associated with CVD and all-cause mortality respectively.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
HTN was significantly associated with CVD/mortality events regardless of glucose tolerance status.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg among pre-diabetic/diabetic population not on antihypertensive medications was generally associated with worse outcomes.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
OBJECTIVE: to determine whether impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is associated with an increased likelihood for ischaemic stroke.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
DESIGN: prospective cohort study.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
"PARTICIPANTS: a sample of 1,032 non-institutionalised people aged 70 years in the Turku Elderly Study Turku Finland.",Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
MEASUREMENTS: the association between IGT (defined as plasma glucose level between 7.80 and 11.09 mmol/l 2 h after administration of 75 g of an oral glucose load) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (defined as the current use of insulin or an oral hypoglycaemic medication a fasting plasma glucose level of >/=7 mmol/l or a plasma glucose level of >/=11.1 mmol/l 2 h after administration of an oral glucose load) with 12-year follow-up for the development of ischaemic stroke.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,1
RESULTS: a total of 742 (71.9%) subjects had normal glucose tolerance 127 (12.3%) subjects had IGT and 163 (15.8%) had DM. Patients were examined in the year 1990 and followed up for stroke occurrence until death or until the end of 2002.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Mean follow-up time was 9.6 years (SD +/ 3.3 years).,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
In total 119 patients (11.5%) suffered a stroke during the follow up.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
In logistic regression model previous stroke previous TIA DM and atrial fibrillation were risk factors for stroke occurrence.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
CONCLUSION: stroke tended to happen more often in the IGT group than in the normal group but the difference was not statistically significant.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Statistically significant risk factors for stroke in elderly people are previous TIA or stroke DM and atrial fibrillation.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Aims:,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
To investigate the sex-specific associations of prediabetes with major clinical outcomes including incident type 2 diabetes chronic kidney disease hypertension coronary heart disease stroke and all-cause mortality.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Methods: Among 8498 Iranian adults from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study aged ≥30 years and without diagnosed type 2 diabetes gender-interactions were assessed for each outcome followed by sex-separated multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of different prediabetes categories including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organization (WHO) as fasting plasma glucose of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and 6.1-6.9 mmol/L respectively and impaired glucose tolerance defined as 2-h post challenge plasma glucose of 7.8-11 mmol/L.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
Results: Sex-specific associations existed for men between IFG-ADA and chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio: 1.28 95% CI 0.99-1.65; p interaction = 0.008) and between IFG-WHO and stroke (hazard ratio: 2.15 95% CI 1.08-4.27; p interaction = 0.21); and for women between IFG-ADA and hypertension (hazard ratio: 1.24 95% CI 1.04-1.48; p interaction = 0.06) and between impaired glucose tolerance and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio: 1.57 95% CI 1.14-2.16; p interaction = 0.05).,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Among both genders all prediabetes definitions were associated with type 2 diabetes but none with mortality.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
Conclusions:,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
The hazards of prediabetes definitions may differ between genders depending on the outcome of interest.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
IFG-WHO among men and impaired glucose tolerance among women are particularly important because of their association with incident stroke and coronary heart disease respectively.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
Considering these sex differences could improve personalized management of prediabetes.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
We evaluate the ability of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) defined by five definitions for predicting both incident CHD and diabetes combined diabetes alone and CHD alone in a Chinese population.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
The screening survey for type 2 diabetes was conducted in 1994.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
A follow-up study of 541 high-risk non-diabetic individuals who were free of CHD at baseline was carried out in 1999 in Beijing area.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
The MetS was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR) American College of Endocrinology (ACE) the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American Heart Association (AHA) (updated NCEP) criteria.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
From a multiple logistic regression adjusting for age sex education occupation smoking family history of diabetes and total cholesterol the relative risk of the ACE-defined MetS for incident diabetes alone (67 cases) was 2.29 (95% CI 1.20-4.34).,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
The MetS defined by the five definitions was associated with a 1.8-3.9 times increased risk for both incident CHD and diabetes combined (59 cases) and with a 1.9-3.0 times for total incident diabetes (126 cases).,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
None of the five definitions predicted either incident CHD alone (177 cases) or total incident CHD (236 cases).,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
In conclusion the MetS defined by the current definitions appears to be more effective at predicting incident diabetes.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
BACKGROUND:,Kim_2016.txt,0
The aim of the present study was to compare the association between cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and prediabetes defined by either fasting plasma glucose (FPG) HbA1c or their combination in a Korean population.,Kim_2016.txt,1
METHODS: In all 76 434 South Koreans who voluntarily underwent a general health examination in the Health Screening & Promotion Center (Asan Medical Center) were analyzed after excluding patients with a previous history of CVD.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Cardiovascular events and death due to CVD during a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (interquartile range 1.9-4.3 years) were identified from the Nationwide Health Insurance Claims Database and death certificates using ICD-10 codes.,Kim_2016.txt,0
RESULTS: Age- and sex adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for overall CVD events were significantly greater for subjects with prediabetes defined by FPG only (HR 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.31) HbA1c only (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.16-1.42) and combined criteria (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.32) compared with the normoglycemic group.,Kim_2016.txt,1
After adjusting for multiple conventional risk factors (e.g. hypertension low-density lipoprotein cholesterol high-density lipoprotein cholesterol smoking status family history of CVD and BMI) the HRs for overall CVD were significantly increased only for participants with prediabetes defined by HbA1c.,Kim_2016.txt,1
Age- and sex adjusted HRs for major ischemic heart disease events were significantly increased for subjects with prediabetes defined either by HbA1c or combined criteria.,Kim_2016.txt,1
Similarly age- and sex-adjusted HRs for percutaneous coronary intervention were significantly higher for subjects with prediabetes defined by HbA1c only.,Kim_2016.txt,1
For diabetes the multivariate-adjusted HRs for all outcomes were significantly increased by all three criteria.,Kim_2016.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Adding an HbA1c criterion when defining prediabetes in Koreans can help identify individuals with an increased risk of CVD.,Kim_2016.txt,1
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease which includes stroke as well as coronary heart disease (CHD).,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
We investigated whether IGT is a risk factor for stroke.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
The incidence of stroke and CHD in a cohort population (n = 2938) consisting of participants of the 1990-1997 Funagata study was assessed through interviews with the participants and their family members and reviews of death certificates and residence transfer documents through 2002.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Glucose tolerance at the baseline was classified according to the criteria of the 1998 World Health Organization (normal glucose tolerance n = 2189; IGT n = 320; and diabetes n = 286).,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
The cumulative incidences among the groups were compared using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and the risks of these conditions were evaluated by person-year and Cox proportional hazard methods.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
During the 147-month (mean 116.5 months) follow-up 158 (normal glucose tolerance IGT and diabetes: 94 35 and 29 respectively) participants experienced a stroke and 94 (54 16 and 24 respectively) experienced CHD.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
By the person-year method IGT and diabetes were shown to be significant risk factors for stroke and CHD (odds ratio 1.87 [95% confidence interval 1.73-2.03] and 3.57 [3.21-3.98] for stroke; 1.53 [1.31-1.78] and 3.47 [2.91-4.14] for CHD respectively).,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that IGT was a risk factor for stroke (age- sex- and hypertension-adjusted hazard ratio: 1.51 [95% confidence interval 1.02-2.24] P = .039) but not for CHD (1.21 [0.69-2.313] .509).,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
Impaired glucose tolerance is a risk factor for future stroke in a Japanese population.,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
Whether prediabetes mellitus alone or combined with other disorders means a higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still controversial.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
This study aimed to investigate the association between prediabetes mellitus and CVD and diabetes mellitus and to explore whether prediabetes mellitus alone or combined with other syndromes such as hypertension could promote CVD risks significantly.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
This longitudinal population-based study of 1609 residents from Shanghai in Southern China was conducted between 2002 and 2014.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Participants with a history of CVD at baseline were excluded from analysis.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Multivariate log binomial regression models were used to adjust possible coexisting factors.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Incidence of CVD during follow-up was 10.1%.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
After adjusting for age sex and other factors the association between prediabetes mellitus and CVD was not observed.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
When hypertension was incorporated in stratifying factors adjusted CVD risk was elevated significantly (odds ratio 2.41; 95% confidence interval 1.25 4.64) in prediabetes mellitus and hypertension combined group and coexistence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension made CVD risk highly significantly increased reaching 3.43-fold higher than the reference group.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Blood glucose level within prediabetic range is significantly associated with elevated risks for diabetes mellitus after multivariable adjustment but only when it is concurrent with other disorders such as hypertension it will significantly increase CVD risk.,Qiu_2015.txt,1
OBJECTIVE: Little information is available on the impact of abnormal glucose tolerance on mortality in South Asian and African populations in the developing world.,Magliano_2010.txt,0

We hypothesized that low fasting glucose would be associated with cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
METHODS:,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
"To test our hypothesis we used both continuous incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards models in 17,287 participants from the Womens Health Initiative with fasting glucose measured at baseline.",Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Participants were separated into groups based on fasting glucose level: low (<80mg/dL) normal/reference (80-99mg/dL) impaired (100-125mg/dL) and diabetic (>=126mg/dL).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,1
RESULTS: Participants were free of cardiovascular disease at enrollment had mean age of 62years and were 52% Caucasian 24% African American 8% Asian and 12% Hispanic.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Median follow-up was 15years.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Graphs of continuous incidence rates compared to fasting glucose distribution exhibited evidence of a weak J-shaped association with heart failure and mortality that was predominantly due to participants with treated diabetes.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Impaired and diabetic fasting glucose were positively associated with all outcomes.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Associations for low fasting glucose differed with coronary heart disease (HR=0.64 (0.42 0.98)) significantly inverse; stroke (0.73 (0.48 1.13)) combined cardiovascular disease (0.91 (0.73 1.14)) and all-cause mortality (0.97 (0.79 1.20)) null or inverse and not significant; and heart failure (1.27 (0.80 2.02)) positive and not significant.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0

BACKGROUND: New diagnostic criteria for diabetes based on fasting blood glucose (FBG) level were approved by the American Diabetes Association.,DECODE_2001.txt,1
The impact of using FBG only has not been evaluated thoroughly.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
The fasting and the 2-hour glucose (2h-BG) criteria were compared with regard to the prediction of mortality.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
METHODS: Existing baseline data on glucose level at fasting and 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test from 10 prospective European cohort studies including 15 388 men and 7126 women aged 30 to 89 years with a median follow-up of 8.8 years were analyzed.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
Hazards ratios for death from all causes cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease and stroke were estimated.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the inclusion of FBG did not add significant information on the prediction of 2h-BG alone (P>.10 for various causes) whereas the addition of 2h-BG to FBG criteria significantly improved the prediction (P<.001 for all causes and P<.005 for cardiovascular disease).,DECODE_2001.txt,0
In a model including FBG and 2h-BG simultaneously hazards ratios (95% confidence intervals) in subjects with diabetes on 2h-BG were 1.73 (1.45-2.06) for all causes 1.40 (1.02-1.92) for cardiovascular disease 1.56 (1.03-2.36) for coronary heart disease and 1.29 (0.66-2.54) for stroke mortality compared with the normal 2h-BG group.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
Compared with the normal FBG group the corresponding hazards ratios in subjects with diabetes on FBG were 1.21 (1.01-1.44) 1.20 (0.88-1.64) 1.09 (0.71-1.67) and 1.64 (0.88-3.07) respectively.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
The largest number of excess deaths was observed in subjects who had impaired glucose tolerance but normal FBG levels.,DECODE_2001.txt,0

"In a subset of 4,730 individuals with additional measures of 2hPG 663 (14.0%) had prediabetes by 2hPG.",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Incidence rates of a major event (nonfatal/fatal CVD or all cause mortality) were compared for different definitions of prediabetes with adjustment for relevant confounders.,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
RESULTS: Compared with that for normoglycemia incidence rate in the context of prediabetes was 54% higher with the WHO/IEC definition and 37% higher with the ADA definition (P < 0.001) but declining to 17% and 12% after confounder adjustment (P >= 0.111).,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
Prediabetes by HbA1c was associated with a doubling in incidence rate for both the IEC and ADA criteria.,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
However upon adjustment excess risk was reduced to 13% and 17% (P >= 0.055) respectively.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Prediabetes by FPG or 2hPG was not associated with an excess risk in the adjusted analysis.,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes defined by HbA1c was associated with a worse prognosis than prediabetes defined by FPG or 2hPG.,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
However the excess risk among individuals with prediabetes is mainly explained by the clustering of other cardiometabolic risk factors associated with hyperglycemia.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0

RESULTS: Men and women with the metabolic syndrome had 48% 39% 64% and 127% greater risks of cardiovascular disease stroke ischaemic heart disease and diabetes respectively than those without the metabolic syndrome.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The increased risks of cardiovascular disease ischaemic heart disease and diabetes remained significant after adjusting for health behaviours bio-clinical factors family history and socio-demographic factors.,Khang_2010.txt,0
Analysis results on population attributable risks showed that about a quarter of total diabetes occurrence and more than 10% of cardiovascular disease was attributable to the metabolic syndrome.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The number of metabolic syndrome components was linearly associated with risks of outcomes.,Khang_2010.txt,0
High blood pressure was significantly associated with all four outcomes while hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia were also important for ischaemic heart disease and diabetes respectively.,Khang_2010.txt,0

The purpose of the study was to assess the cardiovascular risk of impaired fasting glucose (IFG).,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
BACKGROUND:,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The associations between IFG incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) events remains unclear.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
METHODS: The MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study included participants who were 45 to 84 years or age and free of clinical CV disease at baseline (2000 to 2002).,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Type 2 DM was defined as fasting glucose >125 mg/dl or receiving antidiabetes medication at baseline and follow-up examinations; IFG was defined as no T2DM and fasting glucose 100 to 125 mg/dl.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the association between IFG and incident DM and also between IFG and incident CV events.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
"RESULTS: Of 6,753 participants included in these analyses 840 (12.7%) had T2DM and 940 (13.8%) had IFG at the baseline examination.",Yeboah_2011.txt,0
During 7.5 years of follow-up there were 418 adjudicated CV events.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Type 2 DM was associated with an increased CV incidence in the univariate model (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.83 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.25 to 3.56 p < 0.0001) and multivariate model adjusted for demographics and traditional risk factors (HR: 1.87 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.37 p < 0.0001) compared with subjects not having T2DM (IFG plus normal fasting glucose).,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Impaired fasting glucose was associated with increased incidence of T2DM (HR: 13.2 95% CI: 10.8 to 16.2 p < 0.001) that remained after adjusting for demographics highest educational level physical activity and body mass index (HR: 10.5 95% CI: 8.4 to 13.1 p < 0.001) compared with normal fasting glucose.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Impaired fasting glucose was associated with incident CV events in the univariate model (HR: 1.64 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.14 p < 0.001) but not in the full multivariate model (HR: 1.16 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.52 p = 0.3) compared with normal fasting glucose.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Having IFG was not independently associated with an increased short-term risk for incident CV events.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1

To compare risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality associated with different criteria for undiagnosed diabetes and glucose tolerance.,Wild_2005.txt,0
METHODS: A population-based cohort of 758 men and 738 women of 55-74 years of age who had an oral glucose tolerance test or known diabetes at baseline were followed up until death or for 15 years.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Mortality outcomes were compared by baseline diabetes status using people with normal glucose tolerance (i.e. those without diabetes impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance) as the reference group.,Wild_2005.txt,0
RESULTS: Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (fasting glucose of > or = 7.0 mmol/l and/or a 2-h post-challenge glucose of > or = 11.1 mmol/l) was 6.6% of which 81% was associated with fasting glucose > or = 7.0 mmol/l and 19% was associated with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia.,Wild_2005.txt,1
Hazard ratios (95% CI) for all-cause mortality adjusted for age and sex were 1.51 (1.09-2.08) for new diabetes by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criterion (fasting glucose of > or = 7.0 mmol/l regardless of post-challenge glucose) 1.60 (1.20-2.13) for new diabetes by WHO criteria and 1.98 (1.14-3.44) for isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia.,Wild_2005.txt,1
Hazard ratios (95% CI) for cardiovascular mortality adjusted for age and sex were 1.89 (1.17-3.00) 1.73 (1.12-2.66) and 1.08 (0.34-3.40) for new diabetes by ADA and WHO criteria and for isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia respectively.,Wild_2005.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Undiagnosed diabetes was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality by any criteria but significantly increased cardiovascular disease mortality was only associated with diabetes diagnosed using the fasting glucose criterion.,Wild_2005.txt,1
Mortality risks were similar in this population using either ADA or WHO criteria for diagnosis of diabetes.,Wild_2005.txt,0

A 75-g OGTT was performed.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Five diabetes categories were defined: (i) known diabetes (ii) newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose > or =126 mg/dL and no history of diabetes or diabetes medication; ADA-new diabetes) (iii) IPH (iv) impaired fasting glucose (> or =110 - <126 mg/dL; IFG) and (v) normal fasting glucose (<110 mg/dL; NFG).,Lu_2003.txt,1
Surveillance was initiated to determine CVD cancer and all-cause mortality over 9 years.,Lu_2003.txt,0
RESULTS: IPH had a worse CVD risk factor profile than NFG but IPH was associated with a better CVD risk factor profile than known diabetes or ADA-new diabetes.,Lu_2003.txt,0
At follow-up individuals with IFG had no increased risk for CVD or all-cause mortality whereas those with ADA new or known diabetes had significantly increased risk (RR = 1.70 and 1.40 for ADA-new diabetes and RR = 2.87 and 2.19 for known diabetes respectively).,Lu_2003.txt,1
Those with IPH had nonsignificant elevations in risk for CVD (RR = 1.54) and all-cause (RR = 1.27) mortality.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Cancer mortality was not increased in those with IFG IPH ADA-new diabetes or known diabetes compared to those with NFG. CONCLUSIONS: Among American Indians 45 to 74 years of age IPH is associated with nonsignificant elevations in total and CVD mortality.,Lu_2003.txt,1
The magnitude of mortality risk associated with IPH is intermediate between diabetes and IFG.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Because those with IPH are at high risk for diabetes American Indians with IPH should be targeted for diabetes prevention.,Lu_2003.txt,0

The primary outcome studied was all-cause mortality.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Multivariate Cox models were used to estimate relative risk for all-cause mortality.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.2 years forty-three (21.4%) subjects in the IGT group and twenty-nine (11.2%) subjects in the NGT group died (HR 2.05 95% CI 1.28-3.28 P=0.003).,Fang_2019.txt,0
Multivariate,Fang_2019.txt,0
Cox proportional-hazards analysis demonstated that IGT was significantly associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality composite cardiovascular outcome nonfatal stroke and heart failure after adjusting for potential confounding factors.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Logistic regression analysis showed that IGT at baseline (P<0.05) rather than incident type 2 diabetes was a risk factor of all-cause mortality.,Fang_2019.txt,0

OBJECTIVE: Mortality among adults of all ages diagnosed with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) in Tayside Scotland UK was evaluated using routinely collected healthcare data sets.,Evans_2015.txt,0
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using record-linked data in 2003-2008 all instances of blood glucose testing in the population defined 2 cohorts of patients aged 18+years: those with IGR (whether impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)) according to the WHO criteria and those who were normoglycemic.,Evans_2015.txt,1
They were followed in survival analyses for mortality or cardiovascular mortality (censoring deaths that occurred within a 30-day period of testing) to derive HRs (with 95% CI) for IGR status using Cox regression adjusted for age sex and an area measure of deprivation.,Evans_2015.txt,0
RESULTS: There were 2 372 712 tests for 214 094 patients with 196 799 patients in the non-IGR cohort and 50 080 in the IGR cohort.,Evans_2015.txt,0
During follow up 19 147 (9.7%) and 8397 (16.8%) patients died in 2 cohorts respectively with mortality rates of 33.2/1000 patient-years and 70.7/1000 patient-years.,Evans_2015.txt,0
In multivariable analyses the overall adjusted risk of mortality for IGR was 1.16 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.20).,Evans_2015.txt,0
However it was 2.59 (95% CI 2.17 to 3.10) for people aged <45 years decreasing to 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) in those aged 85+years.,Evans_2015.txt,0
The HRs for cardiovascular mortality were lower overall but they followed the same pattern with statistically significant increased risks for patients aged <64 years only.,Evans_2015.txt,0
The mortality risk was highest among patients with IGT.,Evans_2015.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: IGR is associated with an increased mortality risk which declines with age.,Evans_2015.txt,1
It is therefore important to prioritize young people with IGR for prevention; but less important to be aggressive about risk factor modification in older people.,Evans_2015.txt,0

We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of participants without diabetes or cardiovascular disease from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
"We examined the associations of clinical categories of HbA1c (<5.7% 5.7-6.4% >=6.5%) and fasting glucose (<100 100-125 >=126 mg/dL) with outcomes separately among 2,484 black and 8,593 white participants and tested for race interactions.",Selvin_2013.txt,1
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics differed significantly in blacks compared with whites including HbA1c (5.8 vs. 5.4%; P<0.001).,Selvin_2013.txt,0
During 18 years of follow-up there were trends of increased risk of kidney disease fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and stroke across categories of HbA1c in both blacks and whites.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
The adjusted hazard ratios for each outcome across categories of HbA1c were similar in blacks and whites (P for interaction>0.05) except for all-cause mortality.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
Patterns of association were similar but weaker for fasting glucose.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
HbA1c and fasting glucose both were more strongly associated with all-cause mortality in whites compared with blacks largely explained by racial differences in the rate of cardiovascular deaths.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c is a risk factor for vascular outcomes and mortality in both black and white adults.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
Patterns of association for HbA1c were similar to or stronger than those for fasting glucose.,Selvin_2013.txt,0

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors characterized by insulin resistance.,Wang_2007.txt,1
We investigated the relationship of the MetS and its single components defined by all six different criteria with coronary heart disease (CHD) cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in a prospective population-based study.,Wang_2007.txt,1
METHODS AND RESULTS: The MetS was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR) the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Heart Association (updated NCEP) criteria.,Wang_2007.txt,1
We investgated the relationship of the MetS defined by aforementioned six criteria with CHD CVD and all-cause mortality with Cox regression analyses in a non-diabetic Finnish population of 1025 subjects aged 65-74 years during the 13-year follow-up.,Wang_2007.txt,1
The MetS defined by all aforementioned criteria was associated with a statistically significant risk for CVD mortality when adjusted for all confounding variables (Hazards Ratios HRs from 1.31 to 1.51).,Wang_2007.txt,1
The MetS defined by the WHO ACE and IDF criteria was associated with an increased risk of CHD mortality (HRs from 1.42 to 1.58).,Wang_2007.txt,1
There was no association between the MetS by any criteria and all-cause mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Of the single components of the MetS the following predicted CVD mortality in multivariable models: impaired fasting glucose by the WHO NCEP and ACE criteria (HR 1.34) and by the IDF and updated NCEP criteria (HR 1.29); impaired glucose tolerance by the WHO and ACE criteria (HR 1.55); low HDL cholesterol by the EGIR criteria (HR 1.50) and by the NCEP IDF and updated NCEP criteria (HR 1.29); and microalbuminuria according to the WHO definition (HR 1.86).,Wang_2007.txt,1
CONCLUSION: The MetS defined by all six current criteria predicts CVD mortality in elderly subjects.,Wang_2007.txt,1
However of the single components of the MetS IFG IGT low HDL cholesterol and microalbuminuria predicted CVD mortality with equal or higher HRs when compared with the different definitions of the MetS.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Therefore our study suggests that the MetS is a marker of CVD risk but not above and beyond the risk associated with its individual components.,Wang_2007.txt,0

Compared with the non-diabetic and normoglycaemic group (HbA1C <5.7% [<39 mmol/mol] and did not indicate diabetes) undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1C >=6.5% [>=48 mmol/mol] and did not indicate diabetes) inferred an increased risk of mortality for all-causes (HR 1.40 1.09-1.80) and CVD (1.99 1.35-2.94) as did uncontrolled diabetes (diagnosed diabetes and HbA1C >=6.5% [>=48 mmol/mol]) and diabetes with moderately raised HbA1C (diagnosed diabetes and HbA1C 5.7-<6.5% [39-<48 mmol/mol]).,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,1
Those with controlled diabetes (diagnosed diabetes and HbA<5.7% [<39 mmol/mol]) had an increased HR in relation to mortality from CVD only.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,1
Pre-diabetes (those who did not indicate diagnosed diabetes and HbA1C 5.7-<6.5% [39-<48 mmol/mol]) was not associated with increased mortality and raised HbA1C did not appear to have a statistically significant impact upon cancer mortality.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,1

CONCLUSIONS:,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
We found higher rates of all cause and CVD mortality among those with raised HbA1C but not for those with pre diabetes compared with those without diabetes.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
This excess differed by sex and diabetes status.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

This prospective population-based study of 593 inhabitants from northern Finland born in 1935 was conducted between 1996 and 2008.,Cederberg_2010.txt,0
An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted at baseline and follow-up and A1C was determined at baseline.,Cederberg_2010.txt,0
Those with a history of diabetes were excluded from the study.,Cederberg_2010.txt,0
Elevated A1C was defined as 5.7-6.4%.,Cederberg_2010.txt,1
Incident type 2 diabetes was confirmed by two OGTTs.,Cederberg_2010.txt,0
Cardiovascular outcome was measured as incident CVD or CVD mortality.,Cederberg_2010.txt,0
Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to predict diabetes CVD and CVD mortality at 10 years.,Cederberg_2010.txt,0
Receiver operating characteristic curves compared predictive values of A1C IGT and IFG. RESULTS: Incidence of diabetes during the follow-up was 17.1%.,Cederberg_2010.txt,0

METHODS: A population sample of 1974 men and women representative of Turkish adults (mean age 48 years) with normal glucose metabolism (GM) and free of CVD at baseline was prospectively evaluated at a mean 4.1 years of follow-up.,Onat_2005.txt,0
The term abnormal GM designated both DM and impaired fasting glucose (IFG).,Onat_2005.txt,1
Metabolic syndrome was identified in 29% of men and 40% of women by the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines.,Onat_2005.txt,1
Fatal and nonfatal CVD diagnosed by clinical findings and Minnesota coding of resting electrocardiograms developed in 121 subjects.,Onat_2005.txt,0
RESULTS:,Onat_2005.txt,0
The cohort was dichotomized by the presence or absence of MS and of obesity defined by a body mass index of 30 kg/m 2 or greater.,Onat_2005.txt,1
Compared with the major female group with no obesity or MS women with MS regardless of the presence of obesity predicted highly significantly the development of abnormal GM with relative risks exceeding 2 whereas no independent significant association was noted in men with MS.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Similar divergence of sexes pertained to the prediction of diabetes.,Onat_2005.txt,0
When age smoking status grade of physical activity IFG DM and the 4 groups with obesity and MS were analyzed for the prediction of CVD by logistic regression men with MS regardless of the presence of obesity predicted highly significantly CVD (with relative risks ranging from 2 to 4) but neither DM nor IFG contributed independently.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Conversely in women abnormal GM predicted CVD independent of age smoking status and grade of physical activity but the groups with obesity and MS failed to significantly contribute independently.,Onat_2005.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS:,Onat_2005.txt,0
In populations with prevalent MS whereas women with normal GM are prone to DM within the context of MS and are exposed to CVD risk primarily by way of DM men are prone to visceral adiposity less susceptible to DM and run CVD risk primarily by the intermediary of MS largely independent of the DM component.,Onat_2005.txt,0
BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factor research has recently broadened its focus based on new data indicating the benefits of low risk i.e. favorable levels of all major risk factors.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
The aims of this study were to assess further the relation of low risk to coronary heart disease risk and implications for prevention.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
DESIGN:,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
We conducted a prospective population-based Italian study of 7438 men and 13 009 women aged 35-69 years with a mean follow-up of 10.4 years and validated first coronary events.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
METHODS: Baseline coronary heart disease risk was classified into three categories: low risk; unfavorable but not high risk; and high risk.,Palmieri_2006.txt,1
To analyze the relation of these risk profiles to coronary heart disease incidence age-adjusted sex-averaged coronary heart disease incidence was calculated for persons free of coronary heart disease and stroke stratified as baseline low risk unfavorable but not high risk or high risk.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
To assess the independent relationship of individual risk factors to coronary heart disease incidence multivariate proportional hazards models were computed for combinations of risk factors.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
RESULTS: Only 2.7% of participants met low risk criteria; 81.4% were high risk.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
Age-adjusted coronary heart disease incidence for the whole cohort was 37.1 out of 10000 person-years (men 59.0; women 15.3).,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
No coronary heart disease events occurred in low-risk men only two in low-risk women.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
For women and men who were not high risk the age-sex standardized coronary heart disease rate was 62% lower than for high-risk participants.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
Blood pressure need for antihypertensive medication smoking hyperglycemia diabetes total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independently related to coronary heart disease risk.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Although type-2 diabetes is a well-known cause of death the mortality associated with undiagnosed diabetes and early-stage dysglycemia has not been clearly determined.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
METHODS:,Valdes_2009.txt,0
This study included 1015 individuals aged 30-75 years who took part in the first phase of the Asturias study (1998-1999).,Valdes_2009.txt,0
Participants completed a questionnaire and underwent a physical examination and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,Valdes_2009.txt,0
All deaths that occurred in the cohort within 6 years of follow-up (i.e. December 1998 to December 2004) were recorded.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
RESULTS: Participants were divided into four groups according to the condition indicated by their OGTT result in the first phase of the study: normoglycemia pre-diabetes undiagnosed diabetes or diagnosed diabetes (World Health Organization 1999 criteria).,Valdes_2009.txt,1
A total of 42 deaths were recorded during follow-up.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
With normoglycemic individuals acting as a control group multivariate analysis showed that the relative risk of mortality was 2.5 (95% CI 1-6.3) in the group with diagnosed diabetes 2.7 (95% CI 1.1-6.7) in the group with undiagnosed diabetes and 1.6 (95% CI 0.7-4) in the group with pre diabetes.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Both individuals with diagnosed diabetes and those with undiagnosed diabetes had a risk of mortality around 2.5-3 times greater than individuals with normoglycemia.,Valdes_2009.txt,0

"The study population comprised 6,299 participants (aged 18-79 years) of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 who were followed up for mortality for an average of 11.6 years.",Paprott_2015.txt,0
Glycemic status was defined as known diabetes (self-reported diagnosis or intake of antidiabetic medication) and based on HbA1c levels according to American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria as undiagnosed diabetes (>=6.5% [>=48 mmol/mol]) prediabetes with very high (6.0 6.4% [42-46 mmol/mol]) or high diabetes risk (5.7-5.9% [39-41 mmol/mol]) and normoglycemia (<5.7% [<39 mmol/mol]).,Paprott_2015.txt,1
Associations between glycemic status and mortality were examined by Cox regression adjusting for age sex education lifestyle factors anthropometric measures and history of chronic diseases (reference: normoglycemia).,Paprott_2015.txt,0
Spline models were fitted to investigate associations between continuous HbA1c and mortality among participants without known diabetes.,Paprott_2015.txt,0
RESULTS: Excess mortality risk was observed for participants with known diabetes (hazard ratio 1.41 [95% CI 1.08-1.84]) and undiagnosed diabetes (1.63 [1.23 2.17]) but not for those with high (1.02 [0.80-1.30]) or very high diabetes risk (0.87 [0.67-1.13]).,Paprott_2015.txt,0
Spline models revealed a U-shaped association with lowest risk at HbA1c levels 5.4-5.6% (36-38 mmol/mol) and a significantly increased risk at <=5.0% (<=31 mmol/mol) and >=6.4% (>=46 mmol/mol).,Paprott_2015.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike known and undiagnosed diabetes HbA1c levels in the prediabetic range were not associated with an increased mortality risk.,Paprott_2015.txt,0
The observed U-shaped relationship adds to existing evidence that not only high but also low HbA1c levels might be associated with all-cause mortality.,Paprott_2015.txt,0
We studied the association of glucose intolerance with total and cause-specific mortality during a 5-year follow-up of 637 elderly Finnish men aged 65 to 84 years.,Stengard_1992.txt,0

The relative risk of death among diabetic men was 2.10 (95% confidence interval 1.26 to 3.49) and among men with impaired glucose tolerance 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.94) times higher compared with men with normal glucose tolerance.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death in every glucose tolerance group.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
The multivariate adjusted relative risk of cardiovascular death was increased (1.55) in diabetic patients albeit non-significantly (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 2.85).,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Diabetes resulted in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality among men aged 65-74 years but not among the 75- 84-year-old men.,Stengard_1992.txt,1

BACKGROUND:,Warren_2017.txt,0
No consensus on definitions of prediabetes exists among international organisations.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Analysis of associations with different definitions and clinical complications can inform the comparative value of different prediabetes definitions.,Warren_2017.txt,0
We compared the risk of future outcomes across different prediabetes definitions based on fasting glucose concentration HbA1c and 2 h glucose concentration during over two decades of follow-up in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.,Warren_2017.txt,1
We aimed to analyse the associations of definitions with outcomes to provide a comparison of different definitions.,Warren_2017.txt,0
METHODS:,Warren_2017.txt,0
We did a prospective cohort study of participants in the ARIC study who did not have diagnosed diabetes and who attended visit 2 (1990-92; n=10 844) and who attended visit 4 (1996-98; n=7194).,Warren_2017.txt,0
ARIC participants were enrolled from four communities across the USA.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Fasting glucose concentration and HbA1c were measured at visit 2 and fasting glucose concentration and 2 h glucose concentration were measured at visit 4.,Warren_2017.txt,0
We compared prediabetes definitions based on fasting glucose concentration (American Diabetes Association [ADA] fasting glucose concentration cutoff 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff 6.1-6.9 mmol/L) HbA1c (ADA HbA1c cutoff 5.7-6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol] and International Expert Committee [IEC] HbA1c cutoff 6.0-6.4% [42-46 mmol/mol]) and 2 h glucose concentration (ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentration cutoff 7.8-11.0 mmol/L).,Warren_2017.txt,1
FINDINGS: Prediabetes defined using the ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff (prevalence 4112 [38%] of 10 844 people; 95% CI 37.0-38.8) was the most sensitive for major clinical outcomes whereas using the ADA HbA1c cutoff (2027 [19%] of 10 884 people; 18.0-19.4) and IEC HbA1c cutoff (970 [9%] of 10 844 people; 8.4-9.5) and the WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff (1213 [11%] of 10 844 people; 10.6-11.8) were more specific.,Warren_2017.txt,1
After demographic adjustment HbA1c-based definitions of prediabetes had higher hazard ratios and better risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease cardiovascular disease peripheral arterial disease and all-cause mortality than did fasting glucose concentration-based definitions (all p<0.05).,Warren_2017.txt,1
The C-statistic for incident chronic kidney disease was 0.636 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.640 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories (difference -0.005 95% CI -0.008 to -0.001).,Warren_2017.txt,0
The C-statistics were 0.662 for ADA fasting glucose clinical concentration categories and 0.672 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 0.701 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.722 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for peripheral arterial disease and 0.683 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.688 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for all-cause mortality.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Prediabetes defined using the ADA HbA1c cutoff showed a significant overall improvement in the net reclassification index for cardiovascular outcomes and death compared with prediabetes defined with glucose-based definitions.,Warren_2017.txt,1
ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories WHO fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentrations clinical categories were not significantly different in terms of risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease cardiovascular outcomes or mortality outcomes.,Warren_2017.txt,0
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that prediabetes definitions using HbA1c were more specific and provided modest improvements in risk discrimination for clinical complications.,Warren_2017.txt,0

MetS (2001) was defined first using the original criteria from the Third Adult Treatment Panel Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (> or =3 of the following: large waist circumference (women >88 cm men >102 cm) elevated triglycerides (> or =1.70 mmol/L) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (men <1.04 mmol/L women <1.30 mmol/L) elevated fasting glucose (6.1 6.9 mmol/L) and high blood pressure (> or =130/85 mmHg or self-reported use of medications for hypertension).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Subjects were also classified according to the revised definition of the MetS (2005) that applies the lower threshold for fasting glucose (5.6-6.9 mmol/L).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
RESULTS: During follow-up (median 11 years) 818 coronary heart disease (CHD) 401 stroke and 554 congestive heart failure (CHF) events occurred.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Age- and race-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for CHD stroke and CHF were 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.57) 0.94 (95% CI = 0.73-1.21) and 1.40 (95% CI = 1.12-1.76) for women and 1.35 (95% CI = 1.10 1.66) 1.51 (95% CI = 1.08-2.12) and 1.47 (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) for men respectively.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Overall women and men with MetS (2005) were 20% to 30% more likely to experience any CVD event than subjects without MetS (2005).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Using the lower cut-point for IFG resulted in a near tripling in IFG prevalence (16% to 46%) and an additional 9% classified with MetS (2005) but HRs similar to those estimated from the original MetS (2001) criteria.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
High blood pressure was the component most strongly associated with incident CHD.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
CONCLUSION: Results from this study of an elderly population-based cohort provide support for earlier investigations in primarily middle-aged populations that link the presence of MetS with the development of CVD and further underscore the importance of recognizing and treating its individual components particularly high blood pressure.,McNeill_2006.txt,0

Assessment included blood pressure blood tests anthropometry and questionnaires.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Prediabetes was determined by OGTT or HbA1c using either International Expert Committee (IEC) (HbA1c 6.0-6.5% [42-48 mmol/mol]) or American Diabetes Association (ADA) (HbA1c 5.7-6.5% [39-48 mmol/mol]) cut points.,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Incident CHD and stroke were established at 20 years from death certification hospital admission primary care record review and participant report.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
RESULTS: Compared with normoglycemic individuals IEC-defined prediabetes was related to both CHD and CVD risk in Europeans but not South Asians (subhazard ratio for CHD 1.68 [95% CI 1.19 2.38] vs. 1.00 [0.75 1.33] ethnicity interaction P = 0.008 and for CVD 1.49 [1.08 2.07] vs. 1.03 [0.78 1.36] ethnicity interaction P = 0.04).,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Conversely IEC-defined prediabetes was associated with stroke risk in South Asians but not Europeans (1.73 [1.03 2.90] vs. 0.85 [0.44 1.64] ethnicity interaction P = 0.11).,Eastwood_2015.txt,1

To evaluate the metabolic syndrome as an overall risk assessment tool for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in middle-aged British men.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
DESIGN: Prospective study.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
SUBJECTS: A total of 5128 men aged 40-59 years with no history of CVD or diabetes drawn from general practices in 24 British towns and followed up for 20 years.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
RESULTS:,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
The metabolic syndrome (National Cholesterol Expert Panel definition) is associated with a significant increase in risk of total CHD (myocardial infarction angina or CHD death) (relative risk (RR) 95% CI: 1.57 1.39-1.97) stroke (1.61 95% CI: 1.26-2.06) and type 2 diabetes (3.57 95% CI: 2.83-4.50) and is a far stronger predictor of diabetes than of total CHD and stroke in middle-aged men.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
The metabolic syndrome was inferior to the Framingham Risk Score in predicting total CHD or major CVD over 20 years (area under the curve (AUC) 0.58 vs 0.66 for both CHD and CVD; P<0.0001 for difference) but was superior in predicting diabetes (AUC 0.70 vs 0.60; P<0.001).,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
However absolute risk of developing CVD or diabetes over 20 years in those with three or more abnormalities was very high ranging from 41.8% in those with three abnormalities to over a 50% chance in those with four of five abnormalities comparable to the absolute incidence rates in the top 2 fifths of the Framingham distribution.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
CONCLUSION:,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
While the initial aim to use the metabolic syndrome to improve risk prediction of CHD has been disappointing the syndrome identifies patients at high risk of both diabetes and CVD who may derive benefit from lifestyle intervention.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited information is available on the role of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) to predict stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,0
We investigated the relationship of the MetS and its single components defined by 6 different criteria with stroke in a prospective population-based study.,Wang_2008.txt,1
METHODS: The MetS was defined according to the World Health Organization the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) the American College of Endocrinology the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association (updated NCEP) criteria.,Wang_2008.txt,1
We investigated the relationship of the MetS with stroke using Cox regression analyses in 991 Finnish subjects without diabetes aged 65 to 74 years at baseline and followed-up for 14 years.,Wang_2008.txt,0
RESULTS: The MetS defined by the World Health Organization European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance NCEP International Diabetes Federation and updated NCEP criteria was significantly associated with incident stroke (fatal and nonfatal) when adjusted for confounding variables (HR 1.52 to 1.72).,Wang_2008.txt,1
After exclusion of subjects with myocardial infarction these 5 definitions still predicted stroke (HR 1.49 to 1.80).,Wang_2008.txt,0
Of the single components of the MetS the following predicted stroke in multivariable models when subjects with myocardial infarction were excluded: impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) by the World Health Organization and American College of Endocrinology criteria (HR 1.66); insulin resistance (HR 1.60) by the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance criteria; and central obesity (HR 1.52) by the NCEP criteria.,Wang_2008.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: The MetS defined by the 6 criteria except for the American College of Endocrinology definition predicts stroke in elderly subjects.,Wang_2008.txt,1

METHODS: People ( n=6817) of Japanese and Asian Indian origin from five prospective studies in five countries were monitored for 5 to 10 years.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Hazard ratios for death from all causes and CVD were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for FPG 2-h PG and established risk factors.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that an increase in FPG from 7.0 to 8.0 mmol/l (increase of 0.76 SD) increased relative risk (95% CI) by 1.14 (1.05-1.25) for all-cause and 1.24 (1.10-1.39) for CVD mortality.,Nakagami_2004.txt,1
An increase in 2-h PG from 9.0 to 11.9 mmol/l (0.76 SD) increased relative risks by 1.29 (1.18-1.41) and 1.35 (1.19-1.54).,Nakagami_2004.txt,1
Inclusion of 2-h PG in the FPG model improved the predictive value ( p<0.001) whereas FPG did not influence the predictive value of 2-h PG ( p>10).,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
In a model containing FPG and 2 h PG hazards ratios for 2-h PG in subjects with IGT or diabetes were 1.35 (1.03 1.77) or 3.03 (2.18-4.21) for all-cause and 1.27 (0.86-1.88) or 3.39 (2.14-5.37) for CVD mortality compared with normal subjects.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
The respective hazards ratio for FPG in subjects with IFG or diabetes were 0.94 (0.68-1.31) or 0.88 (0.59 1.32) for all-cause and 1.05 (0.67-1.65) or 0.88 (0.51-1.51) for CVD mortality compared with normal subjects.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0

The study population included 1809 individuals aged >=50years free of CVD at baseline with a median follow-up of 12.1years.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
To explore the risk of CVD and mortality associated with the presence of silent CAD (as defined by Minnesota coding criteria for baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) in the absence of a history of CVD) in each of the glucose regulation categories multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the presence of silent CAD compared to the corresponding non silent CAD counterpart as reference.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
RESULTS: During follow-up 382 CVD (321 coronary heart disease) and 208 deaths (91 CVD mortality) occurred.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Among the female population the presence of silent CAD independent of traditional risk factors significantly increased the risk of CVD for population with NFG/NGT [2.40 (1.33-4.35)] and pre-diabetes [HR: 2.04 (1.14-3.63)]; however in the male population the risk was significant for CVD [3.04 (1.53-6.05)] and mortality events [2.60 (1.22-5.56)] in the NDM population and marginally significant for mortality events in NFG/NGT.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
CONCLUSION: Different strategies should be considered for silent CAD in males and females with different levels of glucose regulation.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
It might be justified that screening ECG for prevention of CVD events should be considered mainly among non-diabetic women and men with NDM.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0

To compare the prevalence of diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications in a sample of elderly Japanese-American men; to examine the association with total and cardiovascular mortality by diabetes status using both classifications; and to determine whether the fasting or 2-h glucose measurement is a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Examinations given from 1991 to 1993 in the Honolulu Heart Program were used as baseline for these analyses.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Subjects were 71-93 years of age at that time and were followed for total and cardiovascular disease mortality for up to 7 years.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
RESULTS: A total of approximately 66% of individuals who had diabetes by WHO criteria were missed when the ADA definition was used.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
The relative risks of total and cardiovascular mortality for those with versus those without diabetes were similar for both definitions; however when fasting and postload glucose measures were analyzed as continuous variables the 2-h measurement was a superior predictor and was independent of fasting glucose.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
In contrast fasting glucose was not an independent predictor of these outcomes in the presence of the 2-h measurement.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0

RESULTS:,Selvin_2010.txt,0
The glycated hemoglobin value at baseline was associated with newly diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes.,Selvin_2010.txt,0
For glycated hemoglobin values of less than 5.0% 5.0 to less than 5.5% 5.5 to less than 6.0% 6.0 to less than 6.5% and 6.5% or greater the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for diagnosed diabetes were 0.52 (0.40 to 0.69) 1.00 (reference) 1.86 (1.67 to 2.08) 4.48 (3.92 to 5.13) and 16.47 (14.22 to 19.08) respectively.,Selvin_2010.txt,1

AIMS: British guidelines on vascular disease prevention recommend adding a random (casual) blood glucose measurement to a lipid profile in those aged > or = 40 years.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
To assess this recommendation we compared the predictive value of a risk model based on the Framingham risk score alone to one which additionally included information on fasting blood glucose with respect to incident coronary heart disease (CHD) over 11 years.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
METHOD: Men and women aged 40-63 years in Whitehall II were followed up for incident CHD: death/non-fatal myocardial infarction; angina confirmed by doctor diagnosis or electrocardiogram (ECG) and all first events.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
Fasting blood glucose was specified as a continuous variable or categorized by World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 glycaemic status (normal glucose tolerance impaired fasting glucose or newly diagnosed diabetes).,Brunner_2010.txt,1

The hazard ratio for incident CHD was 1.10 (95%CI 1.09; 1.12) in men and 1.13 (1.10; 1.17) in women per percentage point increase in Framingham risk.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The excess risk remained unchanged in models which added glycaemic status or continuous fasting glucose.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the Framingham score and incident coronary heart disease [0.70 (0.68; 0.73)] did not change when glycaemic status or fasting glucose was added to the prediction model.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
Reclassification with these modified models improved discrimination based on the Framingham score alone when glycaemic status was added net reclassification improvement 2.4% (95% CI 0.2%; 4.6%) but not when fasting glucose was added.,Brunner_2010.txt,0

RESULTS: Among the subjects 18.2% were defined as having MetS; 21.1% had IFG and 6.8% had diabetes.,Liu_2007.txt,1
Metabolic syndrome prevalence in IFG and diabetes was 38.1% and 48.7% respectively and the prevalence of IFG and diabetes in MetS was 44.1% and 18.3% respectively.,Liu_2007.txt,1
After adjusting for nonmetabolic risk factors HRs of total CVD CHD and ischemic stroke in MetS were significant and higher than those in non MetS regardless of glycemic status.,Liu_2007.txt,0
In the absence of MetS the impact of dysglycemia was found only in IFG to CHD and diabetes to ischemic stroke.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Hyperglycemia without any concomitant disorders was not associated with significantly higher risk of CVD.,Liu_2007.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS:,Liu_2007.txt,0
The increased CVD risk in individuals with IFG or diabetes was largely driven by the coexistence of multiple metabolic disorders rather than hyperglycemia per se.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Identification of clustering of metabolic abnormalities should be given more consideration in CVD prevention.,Liu_2007.txt,0
This study aims at estimating the association between different fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) and total mortality during a long-term follow-up.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
"In all 2,300 subjects were health examined out of a stratified sample of 32,185 individuals aged 18-64 years drawn from the population in Stockholm County from the years 1969-70.",Wandell_2005.txt,0
"FBG values were divided into following groups:<3.0 3.0-4.4 4.5-5.5 5.66.0 6.1-6.6 and > 6.6 mmol/l (corresponding to fasting plasma glucose FPG,<3.5 3.5-4.9 5.0-6.0 6.1-6.9 7.0-7.7 and > 7.7 mmol/l) and known diabetes mellitus.",Wandell_2005.txt,1
All participants were followed up in the National Cause of Death Register up to the end of 1996.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox regression with three models the first age- and sex-adjusted the second also adjusted for care need category and hypertension and the third with added BMI-category with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Smoking habits were available for around half of the sample.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Compared to the FBG showing the lowest mortality i.e. FBG 5.6-6.0 mmol/l we found an age- and sex-adjusted excess risk for subjects with known diabetes (HR 7.39 95% CI 3.78-14.45) with FBG > 6.6 mmol/l (HR 2.30 95% CI 1.20-4.39) and with FBG<3.0 mmol/l (HR 3.44 95% CI 1.47-8.06).,Wandell_2005.txt,1
The excess risk persisted when adjusting for care need hypertension BMI and also for smoking.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
The cause of the increased mortality risk with low FBG values is unclear but low FBG value seems to be a risk marker of poor health.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
OBJECTIVES:,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
We sought to determine whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
BACKGROUND:,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
It is unclear which glucose threshold should define prediabetes.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
We compared the 1997 and 2003 American Diabetes Association (ADA) definitions of IFG to predict CVD.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
METHODS: Framingham offspring participants free of CVD categorized by the 1997 ADA IFG definition (fasting plasma glucose 110 to 125 mg/dl; 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l) or the 2003 definition (100 to 125 mg/dl; 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/l) were followed from 1983 to 2004.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Pooled logistic regression was used to calculate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident coronary heart disease (CHD; 291 events) or CVD (423 events).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
RESULTS: Four-year CHD event rates among women were 1.3% (100 to 109 mg/dl) 2.3% (110 to 125 mg/dl) and 2.9% (diabetes); whereas corresponding rates in men were 2.9% 3.0% and 8.7%.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
For the 2003 IFG definition the OR for CHD among women was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 3.0 p = 0.048) whereas for the 1997 IFG definition the OR for CHD in women was 2.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 4.4 p = 0.02) which was almost as high as for women with diabetes (OR 2.5 95% CI 1.2 to 5.2 p = 0.01).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
For CVD only the 1997 IFG definition yielded significantly greater odds of CVD in women (OR 2.1 95% CI 1.2 to 3.6 p = 0.01).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Men were not at increased odds of developing CVD or CHD by either definition.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS:,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
In women both IFG definitions were associated with increased CHD risk whereas neither IFG definition identified men at increased short-term risk for CHD or CVD.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
The finding that women with FPG 110 to 125 mg/dl had similar CHD risk compared with women with diabetes suggests that CHD risk in women may be elevated at a lower glucose level than for men.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
The aim of this study was to determine the 10-year mortality rate of an elderly population aged 70 years or over (n=379) with reference to glucose tolerance status taking into account other determinants of excess mortality.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The baseline examination during 1991-1992 included a postal questionnaire a physical examination and a 2h OGTT which was classified according to both the 1985 WHO criteria and the 1999 WHO criteria.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
Follow-up was continued until death or until 31 December 2001. 66% of men and 51% of women died within 10 years.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
In men the cumulative mortalities were 84% for previously diagnosed diabetes 67% for undiagnosed diabetes 67% for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 60% for normal glucose tolerance (NGT).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The corresponding percentages for women were 76 52 49 and 40%.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Male gender poor self-rated health and previously diagnosed diabetes were the most powerful predictors of mortality.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
When adjustments were made for age gender BMI cardiovascular disease hypertension physical exercise and self-rated health the estimated relative mortality rate was 2.0 (95% CI 1.5-2.7) among previously diagnosed diabetic subjects 1.3 (CI 0.8-2.2) among undiagnosed diabetic subjects and 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among IGT subjects compared to NGT subjects.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
These relative mortalities were higher in women than in men.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
When abnormal glucose tolerance was pooled into one category the OR for excess mortality was 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.9).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
Objective: HbA1c levels are increasingly measured in screening for diabetes; we investigated whether HbA1c may simultaneously improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment using QRISK3 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) scoring systems.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
"Research design and methods: UK Biobank participants without baseline CVD or known diabetes ( n = 357,833) were included.",Welsh_2020.txt,0
Associations of HbA1c with CVD was assessed using Cox models adjusting for classical risk factors.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Predictive utility was determined by the C-index and net reclassification index (NRI).,Welsh_2020.txt,0
"A separate analysis was conducted in 16,596 participants with known baseline diabetes.",Welsh_2020.txt,0
Results:,Welsh_2020.txt,0
"Incident fatal or nonfatal CVD as defined in the QRISK3 prediction model occurred in 12,877 participants over 8.9 years.",Welsh_2020.txt,1
"Of participants 3.3% ( n = 11,665) had prediabetes (42.0-47.9 mmol/mol [6.0-6.4%]) and 0.7% ( n = 2,573) had undiagnosed diabetes (≥48.0 mmol/mol [≥6.5%]).",Welsh_2020.txt,1
In unadjusted models compared with the reference group (<42.0 mmol/mol [<6.0%]) those with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were at higher CVD risk: hazard ratio (HR) 1.83 (95% CI 1.69-1.97) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.96-2.60) respectively.,Welsh_2020.txt,1
After adjustment for classical risk factors these attenuated to HR 1.11 (95% CI 1.03-1.20) and 1.20 (1.04-1.38) respectively.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Adding HbA1c to the QRISK3 CVD risk prediction model (C-index 0.7392) yielded a small improvement in discrimination (C-index increase of 0.0004 [95% CI 0.0001-0.0007]).,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The NRI showed no improvement.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Results were similar for models based on the ACC/AHA and SCORE risk models.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Conclusions:,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The near twofold higher unadjusted risk for CVD in people with prediabetes is driven mainly by abnormal levels of conventional CVD risk factors.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
While HbA1c adds minimally to cardiovascular risk prediction those with prediabetes should have their conventional cardiovascular risk factors appropriately measured and managed.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
OBJECTIVE: Diabetes and prediabetes subjects have increased risk for mortality.,Rhee_2016.txt,0

"MATERIALS/METHODS: Among 241,499 participants of a health-screening program between 2005 and 2012 the risk of death from all causes CVD and cancer was calculated based on the baseline glycemic status (normoglycemia prediabetes and diabetes) and HbA1c levels.",Rhee_2016.txt,0
Uncontrolled diabetes was defined as HbA1c>=7.0%.,Rhee_2016.txt,1
Vital status and confirmation of the cause of death were based on the analysis of death certificate records from the National Death Index.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
"RESULTS: During 923,343.1 person-years of follow-up 877 participants died.",Rhee_2016.txt,0
The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of subjects with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes to normoglycemic subjects for all-cause mortality were 1.58 (95% CI 1.24-2.03) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.78-2.86) respectively.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
The HRs of subjects with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes to normoglycemic subjects for mortality due to cancer were 1.75 (95% CI 1.23-2.48) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.13-2.45).,Rhee_2016.txt,0
However glycemic status was not significantly associated with the risk of mortality due to CVD.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
The subjects with HbA1c higher than 6.5% showed more than 2-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality and the subjects with HbA1c lower than 5.2% showed increased HR (1.45 95% CI 1.06-1.97) compared with those with HbA1c of 5.5% in subjects not taking anti-diabetic medications.,Rhee_2016.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risk from all causes and cancer significantly increased in diabetes subjects regardless of the glucose control status.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
In subjects not taking anti-diabetic medications both high and low HbA1c resulted in increased risk for all-cause mortality.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
BACKGROUND: Persons with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus are at high risk for cardiovascular events.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
However the relationships of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus to the development of subclinical myocardial damage are unclear.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
METHODS AND RESULTS:,Selvin_2014.txt,0
We measured cardiac troponin T with a highly sensitive assay (hs cTnT) at 2 time points 6 years apart among 9051 participants of the community based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study with no diabetes mellitus or prediabetes and without cardiovascular disease including silent myocardial infarction by ECG.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
First we examined the incidence of elevated hs-cTnT (>=14 ng/L) at 6 years of follow-up.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Second we examined clinical outcomes during the subsequent ~14 years of follow-up among persons with and without incident elevations in hs-cTnT.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Cumulative probabilities of elevated hs-cTnT at 6 years among persons with no diabetes mellitus prediabetes and diabetes mellitus were 3.7% 6.4% and 10.8% respectively.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Compared with normoglycemic persons the adjusted relative risks for incident elevated hs-cTnT were 1.40 (95% CI 1.08 1.80) for prediabetes and 2.47 (95% CI 1.78-3.43) for diabetes mellitus.,Selvin_2014.txt,1
Persons with diabetes mellitus and incident elevations in hs-cTnT were at a substantially higher risk of heart failure (hazard ratio 6.37 [95% CI 4.27-9.51]) death (hazard ratio 4.36 [95% CI 3.14-6.07]) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio 3.84 [95% CI 2.52-5.84]) compared with persons without diabetes mellitus and no incident elevation in hs-cTnT.,Selvin_2014.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with the development of subclinical myocardial damage as assessed by hs-cTnT and those persons with evidence of subclinical damage were at highest risk for clinical events.,Selvin_2014.txt,1
These results support a possible deleterious effect of hyperglycemia on the myocardium possibly reflecting a microvascular cause.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
We examined the impact of hyperglycemia on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence comparing criteria based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour plasma glucose (2-hour PG).,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,1
METHODS: Data from 9 European cohorts comprising 18 360 individuals between 25 to 90 years of age were collaboratively analyzed.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
The maximum length of follow-up varied between 4.9 to 36.8 years.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
Hazards ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stroke incidence were estimated using Cox-proportional hazards model adjusting for known risk factors.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
RESULTS:,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
In individuals without a prior history of diabetes the multivariate adjusted hazards ratio for ischemic stroke corresponding to 1 SD increase in FPG was 1.12 (1.02 to 1.22) and in 2-hour PG 1.14 (1.05 to 1.24).,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
Adding 2-hour PG to the model with FPG significantly improved the prediction of the model for the incidence of ischemic stroke (chi(2)=4.72 P=0.03) whereas FPG did not improve the 2-hour PG model prediction (chi(2)=0.25 P=0.62).,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
A significantly increased hazard ratio was also observed for previously diagnosed diabetes (2.26 [1.51 to 3.38]) and for screen-detected diabetes defined by FPG (1.48 [1.08 to 2.02]) and 2-hour PG (1.60 [1.18 to 2.16]).,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,1
None of the criteria predicted hemorrhagic stroke.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes defined by either of the criteria predicted the future risk of ischemic stroke but not the hemorrhagic stroke.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,1
The prediction is stronger for elevated 2-hour PG than for FPG levels.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0

Results:,Wang_2019.txt,0
Of the 111 765 participants 24 881 (22.3%) had normal glucose regulation 61 024 (54.6%) had prediabetes and 25 860 (23.1%) had diabetes.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Mean (SD) age ranged from 52.9 (8.6) years to 59.4 (8.7) years.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Compared with participants with normal glucose regulation among participants with prediabetes the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for CVD was 1.34 (95% CI 1.16-1.55) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and 0.57 (95% CI 0.43-0.75) for participants who had at least 5 ICVHMs; among participants with diabetes the hazard ratios for CVD were 2.05 (95% CI 1.76-2.38) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.56-1.15) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and at least 5 ICVHMs respectively.,Wang_2019.txt,1
Such pattern of association between ICVHMs and CVD was more prominent for participants younger than 55 years (prediabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: hazard ratio [HR] 0.32; 95% CI 0.16-0.63; 1 ICVHM or less: HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.13-2.21; diabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.44-2.26; 1 ICVHM or less: HR 2.46; 95% CI 1.71-3.54; compared with normal glucose regulation) than for participants 65 years or older (prediabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.50-1.26; 1 ICVHM or less: HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.79-1.31; diabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.46-1.35; 1 ICVHM or less: HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.36-2.22 compared with normal glucose regulation; P values for interaction ≤.02).,Wang_2019.txt,1
Additionally the hazard ratio for CVD per additional ICVHM was 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.86) among participants with prediabetes and was 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.89) among participants with diabetes.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Conclusions and relevance:,Wang_2019.txt,0
Participants with prediabetes or diabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs exhibited lower or no significant excess CVD risks compared with the participants with normal glucose regulation.,Wang_2019.txt,0
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prediabetes is a known risk factor for vascular diseases; however its differential contribution to mortality risk from various vascular disease subtypes is not known.,Kim_2017.txt,1
METHODS:,Kim_2017.txt,0
The subjects of the National Health Insurance Service in Korea (2002-2013) nationwide cohort were stratified into normal glucose tolerance (fasting glucose <100 mg/dL) impaired fasting glucose (IFG) stage 1 (100-109 mg/dL) IFG stage 2 (110-125 mg/dL) and diabetes mellitus groups based on the fasting glucose level.,Kim_2017.txt,1
A Cox regression analysis with counting process formulation was used to assess the mortality risk for vascular disease and its subtypes-ischemic heart disease ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.,Kim_2017.txt,0
RESULTS: When adjusted for age sex and body mass index IFG stage 2 but not stage 1 was associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.34) and vascular disease mortality (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.08-1.49) compared with normal glucose tolerance.,Kim_2017.txt,1
Among the vascular disease subtypes mortality from ischemic stroke was significantly higher (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.18-2.18) in subjects with IFG stage 2 but not from ischemic heart disease and hemorrhagic stroke.,Kim_2017.txt,0
The ischemic stroke mortality associated with IFG stage 2 remained significantly high when adjusted other modifiable vascular disease risk factors (HR 1.51; 95% CI: 1.10-2.09) and medical treatments (HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.19-2.57).,Kim_2017.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Higher IFG degree (fasting glucose 110-125 mg/dL) was associated with increased all-cause and vascular disease mortality.,Kim_2017.txt,1
The increased vascular disease mortality in IFG stage 2 was attributable to ischemic stroke but not ischemic heart disease or hemorrhagic stroke in Korean adults.,Kim_2017.txt,0
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:,Schottker_2013.txt,0
This study aimed to assess the cardiovascular risk of individuals with fasting plasma glucose (FPG)- and/or HbA(1c)-defined prediabetes (5.6-6.9 mmol/l and 39-47 mmol/mol [5.7-6.4%] respectively) or manifest diabetes mellitus and to evaluate whether FPG or HbA(1c) can improve risk prediction beyond that estimated by the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) chart in individuals without diabetes mellitus.,Schottker_2013.txt,1
"METHODS: Cox regression was employed to estimate HRs for primary incident cardiovascular events (CVEs) in a cohort of 8,365 individuals aged 50-74 years.",Schottker_2013.txt,0
Furthermore HbA(1c) and FPG were added individually to the variables of the SCORE and measures of model discrimination and reclassification were assessed.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
RESULTS: During 8 years of follow-up 702 individuals had a primary CVE.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
After adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors HRs were attenuated close to one for the prediabetes groups (especially for women) whereas a 1.7- and a 1.9-fold increased risk persisted for men and women with diabetes respectively.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Extension of the SCORE variables by either FPG or HbA(1c) did not improve its predictive abilities in individuals without diabetes.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
There was a non-significant net reclassification improvement for men when HbA(1c) was added (2.2% p = 0.16).,Schottker_2013.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The increased cardiovascular risk of individuals with FPG- or HbA(1c)-defined prediabetes can mainly be explained by other cardiovascular risk factors.,Schottker_2013.txt,0

In baseline and time-dependent models age- and sex-adjusted death rates from natural causes and from IHD were similar among the nondiabetic groups.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Among diabetic subjects natural mortality was higher in those with >or=15 years diabetes duration (death rate ratio [DRR] relative to NGR = 2.6 [95% CI 2.1-3.3]).,Kim_2008.txt,0
IHD mortality was higher in subjects with long diabetes duration (DRR for diabetes 10-15 years = 3.8 [1.5-9.5]; DRR for diabetes >or=15 years = 8.6 [3.8-19.4]) in the time dependent model.,Kim_2008.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Natural and IHD mortality are not increased in Pima Indians with IFG and/or IGT.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Only after the onset of diabetes do the rates of these events increase relative to NGR.,Kim_2008.txt,0
BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The relationship between milder elevations of blood glucose and mortality is less clear.,Barr_2007.txt,0
This study investigated whether impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance as well as diabetes mellitus increase the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"METHODS AND RESULTS: In 1999 to 2000 glucose tolerance status was determined in 10,428 participants of the Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab).",Barr_2007.txt,0
After a median follow-up of 5.2 years 298 deaths occurred (88 CVD deaths).,Barr_2007.txt,0
Compared with those with normal glucose tolerance the adjusted all-cause mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for known diabetes mellitus and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus were 2.3 (1.6 to 3.2) and 1.3 (0.9 to 2.0) respectively.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The risk of death was also increased in those with impaired fasting glucose (HR 1.6 95% CI 1.0 to 2.4) and impaired glucose tolerance (HR 1.5 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0).,Barr_2007.txt,0
Sixty-five percent of all those who died of CVD had known diabetes mellitus newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Known diabetes mellitus (HR 2.6 95% CI 1.4 to 4.7) and impaired fasting glucose (HR 2.5 95% CI 1.2 to 5.1) were independent predictors for CVD mortality after adjustment for age sex and other traditional CVD risk factors but impaired glucose tolerance was not (HR 1.2 95% CI 0.7 to 2.2).,Barr_2007.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS:,Barr_2007.txt,0
This study emphasizes the strong association between abnormal glucose metabolism and mortality and it suggests that this condition contributes to a large number of CVD deaths in the general population.,Barr_2007.txt,0
CVD prevention may be warranted in people with all categories of abnormal glucose metabolism.,Barr_2007.txt,0
BACKGROUND: Although diabetes is a well-known risk factor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases the cardiovascular disease risk of glycemia below the current diabetic threshold remains uncertain.,Sung_2009.txt,0
"METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 652,901 Korean men aged 30 to 64 years from the Korean National Health Insurance System were categorized into 8 groups by fasting blood glucose (FBG) level at baseline and were followed up for cardiovascular diseases occurrence during 1992 2001.",Sung_2009.txt,0
"Over the follow-up period of 8.8 years 10,954 stroke and 3766 myocardial infarction events occurred.",Sung_2009.txt,0
In age-adjusted analyses there was evidence of linear associations between FBG and myocardial infarction ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke.,Sung_2009.txt,0
However with additional adjustment for socioeconomic position behaviors and other cardiovascular disease risk factors the associations with myocardial infarction and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke were markedly attenuated with increased risk only at the highest FBG levels (> or =7.5 mmol/L).,Sung_2009.txt,0
With full adjustment the association with ischemic stroke persisted; a linear increase in the risk of ischemic stroke was observed from FBG level of 5.6 mmol/L.,Sung_2009.txt,0
When the analyses were repeated with those persons who had been diagnosed with diabetes removed there was no evidence of associations of FBG with intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke but the association with ischemic stroke persisted.,Sung_2009.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS:,Sung_2009.txt,0
In this Korean male population the association with high FBG differed between ischemic stroke intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction.,Sung_2009.txt,0
The linear increase in the risk of ischemic stroke independently of other cardiovascular risk factors was observed at a level below the current FBG criteria for impaired fasting glucose (> or =5.6 mmol/L).,Sung_2009.txt,1
However for other cardiovascular diseases the current cutoff for diagnosing diabetes appropriately identified Korean men at risk.,Sung_2009.txt,0
OBJECTIVES: Diabetes and obesity each increases mortality but recent papers have shown that lean Asian persons were at greater risk for mortality than were obese persons.,Ma_2012.txt,0
The objective of this study is to determine whether an interaction exists between body mass index (BMI) and diabetes which can modify the risk of death by cardiovascular disease (CVD).,Ma_2012.txt,0
METHODS: Subjects who were over 20 years of age and who had information regarding BMI past history of diabetes and fasting blood glucose levels (n=16 048) were selected from the Korea Multi center Cancer Cohort study participants.,Ma_2012.txt,0
By 2008 a total of 1290 participants had died; 251 and 155 had died of CVD and stroke respectively.,Ma_2012.txt,0
The hazard for deaths was calculated with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) by Cox proportional hazard model.,Ma_2012.txt,0
RESULTS: Compared with the normal population patients with diabetes were at higher risk for CVD and stroke deaths (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.33 to 2.56; HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.76; respectively).,Ma_2012.txt,0
Relative to subjects with no diabetes and normal BMI (21 to 22.9 kg/m(2)) lean subjects with diabetes (BMI <21 kg/m(2)) had a greater risk for CVD and stroke deaths (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.57 to 5.09; HR 3.27; 95% CI 1.58 to 6.76; respectively) while obese subjects with diabetes (BMI >=25 kg/m(2)) had no increased death risk (p interaction <0.05).,Ma_2012.txt,1
This pattern was consistent in sub-populations with no incidence of hypertension.,Ma_2012.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS:,Ma_2012.txt,0
This study suggests that diabetes in lean people is more critical to CVD deaths than it is in obese people.,Ma_2012.txt,0
OBJECTIVE:,Wen_2005.txt,0
The objective of this article was to assess mortality risks at different levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) in Taiwan with particular attention to those pre-diabetic subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG).,Wen_2005.txt,0
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Governmental employees and schoolteachers were followed up for an average of 11 years.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"With the use of Cox regression analyses mortality risks were calculated for 36,386 subjects aged 40-69.",Wen_2005.txt,0
RESULTS: FBG > or =110 mg/dl was associated with increased mortality risks for all causes cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes.,Wen_2005.txt,1
IFG when defined as 110-125 mg/dl was associated with a significant increase for CVD and/or diabetes mortality.,Wen_2005.txt,1
These mortality risks remained elevated when known CVD risk factors were adjusted for.,Wen_2005.txt,0
The IFG group shared risk factor characteristics more with the FBG > or =126 mg/dl group than with the FBG <110 mg/dl group.,Wen_2005.txt,1
When IFG was defined as 100-125 mg/dl the number of subjects quadrupled but mortality risks diminished substantially because of the inclusion of 100-109 mg/dl group.,Wen_2005.txt,1
The lowest FBG group 50-75 mg/dl had a significant 2-fold risk from all causes.,Wen_2005.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS:,Wen_2005.txt,0
There was an overall J-shaped relationship between all-cause mortality and FBG.,Wen_2005.txt,0
IFG when defined as 110-125 mg/dl is an independent risk factor and should be aggressively treated as a disease because its subsequent mortality risks for CVD and diabetes were significantly increased.,Wen_2005.txt,1
The newly defined IFG at 100-125 mg/dl did not have the predictive power for later increases in CVD or diabetes mortality.,Wen_2005.txt,1
Impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L [110 to 125 mg/dL]) is a common glycemic disorder which usually progress to diabetes mellitus.,Henry_2002.txt,1
The relationships between impaired fasting glucose other risk factors including blood pressure and mortality have never been clearly investigated.,Henry_2002.txt,0
We studied 63 443 consecutive men (ages 21 to 60 years) each of whom had a routine health examination with a fasting plasma glucose measurement.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Men with known ischemic cardiac disease and treatment for diabetes or hypertension were excluded.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Impaired fasting glucose was found in 10 773 (17.0%) of these men.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Mean body mass index serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and systolic diastolic and pulse blood pressure were significantly higher for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with those men with normal fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 3.9 to 6.0 mmol/L).,Henry_2002.txt,0
When adjusted for confounding variables relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with impaired fasting glucose was dependent on systolic blood pressure level (1.02 [95% CI: 0.62 to 1.70] when <140 mm Hg and 2.10 [95% CI: 1.16 to 3.80] between 140 and 160 mm Hg).,Henry_2002.txt,1
Inversely relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with moderate systolic hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg) compared with normal systolic blood pressure (<140 mm Hg) was highly dependent on the glycemic status (2.97 [95% CI: 1.58 to 5.55] for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with 1.35 [95% CI: 0.84 to 2.18] in those with normal fasting glucose).,Henry_2002.txt,1
Similar results were found concerning overall mortality.,Henry_2002.txt,0
In conclusion the presence of moderate systolic hypertension can identify subjects with impaired fasting glucose who are at risk of cardiovascular and overall mortality and vice versa probably through the metabolic syndrome.,Henry_2002.txt,0
To determine whether the clustered features of the metabolic syndrome precede the 7 year incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes we examined 6182 Japanese male office workers aged 35-59 years without any history of CVD.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
The 5588 subjects without type 2 diabetes also constituted the nondiabetic cohort and were re-examined over seven successive years.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Components of the metabolic syndrome included glycemic disorder (type 2 diabetes for the risk of CVD and impaired fasting glucose for the risk of type 2 diabetes) systemic obesity hypertension dyslipidemia proteinuria and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
"After controlling for age family history of diabetes alcohol intake and cigarette smoking the multivariate-adjusted relative risk of incidence of CVD compared with absence of components was 3.18 3.48 12.55 and 14.15 (P for trend <0.001) for the presence of 1,2,3 and > or =4 components respectively.",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
The corresponding relative risks of incidence of type 2 diabetes were 1.92 4.36 6.44 and 15.08 (P for trend <0.001).,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
In both non-smokers and current smokers the multivariate-adjusted relative risks of incidence of CVD and type 2 diabetes increased as the number of components increased (P for trend <0.001 for all).,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Our findings indicate that clustered features of the metabolic syndrome are closely associated with development of CVD and type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Japanese.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Stroke occurs particularly frequently in elderly people and being more often disabling than fatal entails a high social burden.,Mazza_2001.txt,1

Historical and clinical data blood tests and 14 year fatal events were recorded.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Continuous items were divided into quintiles and for each quintile adjusted relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals [CI] was derived from multivariate Cox analysis.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Age historical stroke (RR: 5.2; 95% CI: 3.18-8.6) and coronary artery disease (RR: 1.38; CI: 1.18-2.1) atrial fibrillation (RR: 2.40; CI: 1.42-4.0) arterial hypertension (RR: 1.33; CI: 1.15 1.76) systolic blood pressure > or = 163 mmHg (RR: 1.84; CI: 1.20-2.59) pulse pressure > or = 74 mmHg (RR: 1.50; CI: 1.13-2.40) cigarette smoking (RR: 1.60; CI: 1.03-2.47) electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (RR: 1.72; CI: 1.10-2.61) impaired glucose tolerance (IGT RR: 1.83; CI: 1.10-3.0) uric acid (UA) > 0.38 mmol/l (RR: 1.61; CI: 1.14-2.10) serum potassium > or = 5 mEq/l (RR: 1.70; CI: 1.24-2.50) and serum sodium < or = 139 mEql/l (RR: 1.34; 1.10-2.10) increased the risk of stroke.,Mazza_2001.txt,1
In the CASTEL stroke was the first cardiovascular cause of death.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Some independent predictors usually unrelated to stroke mortality (namely pulse pressure pre-diabetic IGT UA and blood electrolytes disorders) have been identified.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies have shown the association between glucose tolerance status defined by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and the development of different types of cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,1
METHODS: A total of 2421 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged 40 to 79 years who underwent the oral glucose tolerance test were followed up for 14 years.,Doi_2010.txt,0
RESULTS:,Doi_2010.txt,0
In multivariable analysis the risks of ischemic stroke in both sexes and coronary heart disease (CHD) in women were significantly higher in subjects with diabetes determined by the World Health Organization criteria than in those with normal glucose tolerance even after adjustment for other confounding factors but such association was not seen for CHD in men (ischemic stroke: adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=2.54 P=0.002 in men; adjusted HR=2.02 P=0.03 in women; CHD: adjusted HR=1.26 P=0.47 in men; adjusted HR=3.46 P=0.002 in women).,Doi_2010.txt,1
Similar associations were observed for fasting plasma glucose levels of >or=7.0 mmol/L (ischemic stroke: adjusted HR=2.15 P=0.03 in men; adjusted HR=2.10 P=0.045 in women; CHD: adjusted HR=1.29 P=0.47 in men; adjusted HR=3.83 P=0.003 in women) and for 2 hour postload glucose levels of >or=11.1 mmol/L (ischemic stroke: adjusted HR=2.71 P=0.003 in men; adjusted HR=2.19 P=0.03 in women; CHD: adjusted HR=1.58 P=0.16 in men; adjusted HR=4.44 P<0.001 in women).,Doi_2010.txt,1
The age-adjusted incidences of ischemic stroke and CHD did not significantly increase in subjects with impaired fasting glycemia or impaired glucose tolerance in either sex.,Doi_2010.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diabetes is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke in both sexes and CHD in women in the Japanese population.,Doi_2010.txt,0
BACKGROUND:,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
The new fasting American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus rely mainly on fasting blood glucose concentrations and use a lower cut-off value for diagnosis than the WHO criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
We aimed to assess the sensitivity of these criteria for the detection of cardiovascular disease the main complication of diabetes mellitus in the elderly.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
METHODS:,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
We did a cross-sectional and prospective analysis of 4515 participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study an 8 year longitudinal study designed to identify factors related to the onset and course of cardiovascular disease in adults aged at least 65 years.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
We calculated the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease for the ADA and WHO criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
FINDINGS:,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
There was a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease among individuals with impaired glucose or newly diagnosed diabetes by both criteria than among those with normal glucose concentrations.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
"However because fewer individuals had abnormal glucose states by the fasting ADA criteria (22.3%) than by the WHO criteria (46.8%) the number of cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to abnormal glucose states was a third of that attributable by the WHO criteria (53 vs 159 cases per 10,000).",Barzilay_1999.txt,1
For the two sets of criteria the relative risk for incident cardiovascular disease (mean follow-up 5.9 years) was higher in individuals with impaired glucose and newly diagnosed diabetes than in those with normal glucose.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Individuals classified as normal by the fasting ADA criteria had a higher absolute number of incident events (455 of 581 events) than those classified as normal by the WHO criteria (269 of 581 events).,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
Fasting ADA criteria were therefore less sensitive than the WHO criteria for predicting cardiovascular disease among individuals with abnormal glucose (sensitivity 28% vs 54%).,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
INTERPRETATION:,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
The new fasting ADA criteria seem to be less predictive than the WHO criteria for the burden of cardiovascular disease associated with abnormal glucose in the elderly.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
BACKGROUND:,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Whether prediabetes is an independent risk factor for incident heart failure (HF) in non-diabetic older adults remains unclear.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
METHODS: Of the 4602 Cardiovascular Health Study participants age>=65 years without baseline HF and diabetes 2157 had prediabetes defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125 mg/dL.,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
Propensity scores for prediabetes estimated for each of the 4602 participants were used to assemble a cohort of 1421 pairs of individuals with and without prediabetes balanced on 44 baseline characteristics.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 73 years 57% were women and 13% African American.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Incident HF occurred in 18% and 20% of matched participants with and without prediabetes respectively (hazard ratio {HR} associated with prediabetes 0.90; 95% confidence interval {CI} 0.76-1.07; p=0.239).,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for incident HF associated with prediabetes among 4602 pre-match participants were 1.22 (95% CI 1.07-1.40; p=0.003) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.85-1.14; p=0.826) respectively.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Among matched individuals prediabetes had no independent association with incident acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.81-1.28; p=0.875) angina pectoris (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.77-1.12; p=0.451) stroke (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70-1.06; p=0.151) or all cause mortality (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.88-1.11; p=0.840).,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS:,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
We found no evidence that prediabetes is an independent risk factor for incident HF other cardiovascular events or mortality in community-dwelling older adults.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
These findings question the wisdom of routine screening for prediabetes in older adults and targeted interventions to prevent adverse outcomes in older adults with prediabetes.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
BACKGROUND:,Hunt_2004.txt,0
To assess the utility of clinical definitions of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) to identify individuals with increased cardiovascular risk we examined the relation between the MetS using both the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and the World Health Organization definitions and all cause and cardiovascular mortality in San Antonio Heart Study participants enrolled between 1984 and 1988.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 2815 participants 25 to 64 years of age at enrollment 509 met both criteria 197 met NCEP criteria only and 199 met WHO criteria only.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Over an average of 12.7 years 229 deaths occurred (117 from cardiovascular disease).,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Moreover in the primary prevention population of 2372 participants (ie those without diabetes or cardiovascular disease at baseline) 132 deaths occurred (50 from cardiovascular disease).,Hunt_2004.txt,0
In the primary prevention population the only significant association adjusted for age gender and ethnic group was between NCEP-MetS and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.01; 95% CI 1.13-3.57).,Hunt_2004.txt,0
In the general population all cause mortality HRs were 1.47 (95% CI 1.13-1.92) for NCEP-MetS and 1.27 (95% CI 0.97-1.66) for WHO-MetS.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
Furthermore for cardiovascular mortality there was evidence that gender modified the predictive ability of the MetS.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
For women and men respectively HRs for NCEP-MetS were 4.65 (95% CI 2.35-9.21) and 1.82 (95% CI 1.14-2.91) whereas HRs for WHO-MetS were 2.83 (95% CI 1.55-5.17) and 1.15 (95% CI 0.72-1.86).,Hunt_2004.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS:,Hunt_2004.txt,0
In summary although both definitions were predictive in the general population the simpler NCEP definition tended to be more predictive in lower-risk subjects.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
OBJECTIVE:,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
To optimize identification of future diabetic patients the American Diabetes Association (ADA) introduced criteria for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in 1997 (IFG 6.1 mmol/l [IFG6.1]) and lowered the threshold from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l (IFG5.6) in 2003.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
Our aim was to assess the consequences of lowering the IFG cutoff on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and to evaluate whether this risk is explained by a conversion to type 2 diabetes within 6.4 years.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
"In a population-based cohort the Hoorn Study plasma glucose was determined in 1989 and 1996 (n = 1,428).",Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
Subjects were classified in 1989 according to 1997 and 2003 ADA criteria.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
Subjects with IFG in 1989 were further classified according to diabetes status in 1996.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
Hazard ratios for CVD mortality (n = 81) in the period 1996-2005 were adjusted for age and sex.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
RESULTS: Subjects with IFG6.1 but not IFG5.6 had a significantly higher CVD mortality risk than normal fasting glucose (NFG) subjects.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
Subjects who converted from IFG to diabetes (IFG6.1: 42%; IFG5.6: 21%) had a more than twofold risk of CVD mortality (IFG6.1: 2.47 [1.17-5.19]; IFG5.6: 2.14 [1.12-4.10]) than subjects with NFG.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
IFG subjects who did not develop diabetes did not have significantly higher CVD mortality risks (IFG6.1: 1.50 [0.72-3.15]; IFG5.6: 1.15 [0.69-1.93]).,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS:,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
The lower cutoff for IFG (ADA 2003 criteria) results in a category of IFG that no longer represents a high-risk state of CVD.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
Furthermore only subjects who convert from IFG to diabetes have a high risk of CVD mortality.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0

This discrepancy could result from the fact that a single glucose measurement used to define IFG has high intra-individual variation.,Kim_2016.txt,0
In addition IFG defined by FPG criteria only may include some patients with diabetes who have non-diabetic fasting but diabetic post-challenge glucose levels and could exclude some individuals with prediabetes who have normal fasting but prediabetic post-challenge glucose levels (i.e. isolated IGT).,Kim_2016.txt,1

A known major sex difference is that men have unfavorable body fat distribution and higher vulnerability to CVD.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been assessed to prevail equally in most populations (with some evidence of male preponderance in early middle age) although having exhibited a pronounced preponderance in women in the first half of the last century [1].,Onat_2005.txt,1
A recent study of known diabetes in 8 European countries reported no consistent sex differences in national prevalence rates [2].,Onat_2005.txt,0

2 In 2009 the International Expert Committee (IEC) recommended HbA 1c of 6•0-6•4% (42-46 mmol/mol) for the identifi cation of an intermediate risk group which has been adopted by some organisations.,Warren_2017.txt,1

he American Diabetes Association had previously recommended (1) the recognition of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as a category of glucose tolerance analogous to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).,Tai_2004.txt,1
It was recommended that IFG be diagnosed in those with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
Since then many analyses have examined the equivalence of FPG and 2-h postchallenge glucose (2-h PG) in predicting both diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).,Tai_2004.txt,0
Several key findings have emerged from these studies.,Tai_2004.txt,0
"First the association between IGT and CVD events and mortality is stronger than that for IFG (2,3).",Tai_2004.txt,0
"Second although IFG and IGT identify some of the same individuals the degree of overlap is variable (4,5).",Tai_2004.txt,0
As a consequence of the recommendations to use FPG rather than 2-h PG for the diagnosis of diabetes many subjects with IGT who are at risk of future CVD events would not be identified.,Tai_2004.txt,0
On the basis of the aforementioned findings the American Diabetes Association has recently recommended (6) that the lower limit for the diagnosis of IFG be changed from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
"However the need for this change has been questioned by others (7,8).",Tai_2004.txt,0
Singapore is a small country in Asia with a high prevalence of diabetes and IGT.,Tai_2004.txt,0
As in Europe and the U.S. we have found that IFG and IGT often identify different individuals.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Only 26% of subjects with IGT had IFG (as defined by the older criteria of FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l) and 50% of those with IFG had IGT (9).,Tai_2004.txt,1
We have also recently reported that IGT is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (10) and diabetes (11).,Tai_2004.txt,1
The majority of these IGT subjects also had FPG Ͻ6.1 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The aims of this study were: 1) to identify the optimal level of fasting glucose that would allow the identification of those with IGT and those at risk of incident diabetes 2) to determine the effect of lowering the criterion for the diagnosis of IFG on disease prevalence and 3) to determine the risk of future diabetes and CVD associated with the different levels of FPG and compare them against those associated with IGT.,Tai_2004.txt,0

3 Recently the American Diabetes Association 4 recommended that the lower limit for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) be changed from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/L.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Although the NHLBI 5 has officially adopted this lower threshold for fasting glucose as part of its revised definition of MetS (2005) the effect of this modification on the population prevalence of IFG and MetS has not been fully elucidated.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
6 Furthermore several population-based studies [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] have reported that ATP-III-defined MetS (2001) is associated with approximately twice the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) although these studies were conducted primarily in middle-aged populations and as such their findings may not be applicable to elderly populations.,McNeill_2006.txt,1

Thus its conclusions may have limited generalizability because treatment for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is common in older age.,McNeill_2006.txt,0

The definition of IFG fasting blood glucose (FBG) at 110 -125 mg/dl was lowered to FBG 100 -125 mg/dl in 2003 (5).,Wen_2005.txt,1
Such a modification provoked controversy and was challenged as to its appropriateness (6 -10).,Wen_2005.txt,0
"It reportedly would more than double the number of those with pre-diabetes in the U.S. (6,11) or in Singapore (10).",Wen_2005.txt,0
The basis for such lowering was not made immediately clear (5) but it seems to have come more from theoretical extrapolations from a few studies than from long-term outcome studies.,Wen_2005.txt,0
For the purpose of predicting diabetes from pre-diabetes the lowering of the IFG cut point was an attempt to reduce falsenegative results and to increase truepositive results to the maximal extent.,Wen_2005.txt,0
However in so doing a large number of false-positive results are created.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"Al-though the benefits of early intervention have been assumed whether it is still cost effective to intervene in a much larger population with pre-diabetes one that more than doubles the original number of subjects with IFG remains unsettled (6,8).",Wen_2005.txt,0
"Nevertheless the recent change reflected the trend to lower the cut point for either diabetes or pre-diabetes by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (1,4) with the expectation that progression of pre-diabetes into diabetes or the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) can be prevented through earlier awareness and intervention (3,12,13).",Wen_2005.txt,1
"IFG or pre-diabetes is ""not considered as a clinical entity in its own right but rather a risk factor for future diabetes"" (14).",Wen_2005.txt,1
"The reason is that although IFG is associated with elevated mortality risks (2,(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21) these risks could attenuate or lose statistical significance when associated risk factors were adjusted.",Wen_2005.txt,1
Because only a few studies assessed the long-term risks of IFG and were based mainly on Caucasian populations with largely inconclusive results (21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29) we evaluated this subject from an on-going large cohort study in Taiwan by calculating the mortality risks at different levels of FBG.,Wen_2005.txt,0

Because of the epidemic of overweight and sedentary lifestyle worldwide [1] the metabolic syndrome defined by a cluster of risk factors including central obesity hypertension and dyslipidemia with or with-out glycemic disorder has been found in many ethnic groups and is becoming increasingly common [2].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
"The metabolic syndrome is most important because of its association with subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [3,4].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Although this syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance and is also known as the insulin resistance syndrome the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed to call it the metabolic syndrome rather than the insulin resistance syndrome in 1998 because it has not yet been established whether insulin resistance is the cause of all the metabolic disorders or vice versa [5].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
"The features of the metabolic syndrome have been reported to precede the detection of type 2 diabetes by as much as 10 years at which time the known increased risk of CVD has been documented [6,7].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Therefore the importance of the metabolic syndrome from both a clinical and public health perspective may be greatest in its earlier stages before development of CVD or diabetes.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
The aim of our longitudinal population study based on the results of serial annual health examinations at the workplace was to examine whether by focusing on the components of the metabolic syndrome an increased risk of development of CVD and type 2 diabetes might be detected during the following 7 years in middle-aged Japanese men.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Stroke is the primary cause of cardiovascular death in Eastern and the secondary one in Western societies [1].,Mazza_2001.txt,1

Although the incidence of stroke rises sharply with advancing age studies assessing the risk of stroke in the elderly are sparse and almost limited to men [8][9][10][11][12][13].,Mazza_2001.txt,0

"Prediabetes is associated with increased risk of type II diabetes [1] which in turn is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes [2,3].",Deedwania_2013.txt,1
Prediabetes has also been observed to be associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events in younger adults [4].,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
However it is unknown whether prediabetes would also be associated with poor outcomes in older adults who might be exposed to multiple other competing risk factors.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
"Further whether the association of prediabetes with cardiovascular events is truly independent has not been examined in well-balanced propensity score-matched populations [5,6].",Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Importantly if prediabetes indeed had an independent association with incident cardiovascular events whether that would translate into higher mortality in older adults with prediabetes has not been previously examined.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
This is important as the prevalence of prediabetes increases with age [7].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Therefore we examined the independent associations of prediabetes with incident heart failure (HF) and other cardiovascular events and all-cause and cause-specific mortalities in propensity-matched cohorts of community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).,Deedwania_2013.txt,0

mpaired glucose regulation is a highrisk state for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1).,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
Impaired glucose regulation can be either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) i.e. elevated glucose levels 2 h after the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
"Both conditions contribute independently to the high risk of diabetes and CVD but show limited agreement (2,3).",Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
When the American Diabetes Association (ADA) introduced fasting diagnostic criteria in 1997 to avoid the OGTT (4) which is not com-monly used in clinical practice the cutoff for IFG was set at 6.1 mmol/l (IFG6.1).,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
In 2003 the ADA decided that this value should be lowered from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l (IFG5.6) (5).,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
This new cutoff for the definition of IFG was selected as the level of fasting glucose with the optimal sensitivity and specificity to predict incident diabetes in four population studies including the Hoorn Study.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
However the consequences of lowering the fasting glucose cutoff in the definition of IFG for the risk of CVD were not evaluated.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
Because prevention programs at present are targeted at impaired glucose regulation to avoid both diabetes as well as CVD this point needs to be addressed.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
Thus does IFG confer a high-risk state of CVD even in individuals who do not develop diabetes at a later stage?,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,1
For IGT it has been shown that the elevated CVD risk was also present in subjects who remained IGT or returned to normal glucose tolerance (6).,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
Such information is not yet available for subjects with IFG.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0
The aims of the present study were 1) to assess the impact of lowering the IFG cutoff on the prevalence of IFG and the incidence of diabetes among subjects classified as IFG in 1989 2) to assess the impact of lowering the IFG cutoff on the associated risk of all-cause and CVD mortality and 3) to study if the association between IFG and the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality is independent of the conversion to diabetes during follow-up.,Rijkelijkhuizen_2007.txt,0

Comparing nested models inclusion of the fasting glucose categories did not significantly improve the prediction of the 2-hour glucose alone in contrast addition of the 2-hour categories to the fasting glucose categories significantly improved the prediction (except in the case of stroke mortality) (Table 5).,DECODE_2001.txt,0

Previously known diabetic subjects had worse survival profiles for fatal CVD and CHD events than those observed in the newly diagnosed diabetic subjects according to either the fasting or the 2-hour glucose criteria.,DECODE_2001.txt,0

The fact that inclusion of the 2-hour glucose with the fasting glucose criteria significantly improved the prediction indicates that the predictive ability of the fasting glucose largely depended on the levels of 2-hour glucose.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
Conversely that fasting glucose levels did not add statistically significant information on the prediction of deaths once the 2-hour value was included in the model demonstrated that the relation between the 2-hour glucose level and the risk of deaths was independent of the fasting glucose levels.,DECODE_2001.txt,0

It could be argued that the excess risk of death in diabetic subjects on the 2-hour glucose criteria could have been attributed to the older age in this group.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
However age has been adjusted for in the data analyses and the age difference was too small (only 2 years) to have any serious impact on mortality.,DECODE_2001.txt,0

This study contributes information to the debate regarding the interpretation of HbA 1c in clinical practice and implies that calls for race-specific HbA 1c cut-points for diagnosis of diabetes do not reflect long-term risk associations.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
Our findings support a similar interpretation of HbA 1c test results in blacks and whites for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
We hope these data will alleviate concerns regarding the use of HbA 1c in blacks.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
As evidenced by the baseline characteristics of this study population the majority of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors differ substantially by race/ethnicity.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
It has been proposed that nonglycemic determinants of HbA 1c such as erythrocyte turnover hemoglobin characteristics and glycation rate may differ across race groups.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
"Nonetheless the primary determinant of elevated HbA 1c is circulating glucose (38,39).",Selvin_2013.txt,0
"It is likely that nonglycemic factors are relatively more important at very low HbA 1c levels (40,41).",Selvin_2013.txt,0
Our results suggest that at prediabetic and diabetic levels of HbA 1c  there are no racial differences in their association with longterm risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
We observed an attenuated association between HbA 1c categories and allcause mortality in blacks compared with whites and no association between fasting glucose and mortality in blacks.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
We also observed similar attenuation and no association of fasting glucose categories with heart failure in blacks although the interactions terms were not statistically significant.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
We found that these results may be explained by differences in rates of vascular causes of death in blacks and whites (33).,Selvin_2013.txt,0
The overall weaker association of elevated fasting glucose with outcomes in both blacks and whites may partially reflect the higher variability in fasting glucose compared with HbA 1c (42).,Selvin_2013.txt,0
We previously have observed that at the same value of HbA 1c at baseline blacks are less likely than whites to receive a subsequent diagnosis of diabetes (32).,Selvin_2013.txt,0

Values are per 1 SD per 0.62% points of HbA 1c  and per 18.6 mg/dL of fasting glucose.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
values are artificially elevated in blacks and that such elevations are independent of the complex processes by which hyperglycemia leads to long-term complications.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
Our findings are reassuring and suggest that the new diagnostic cut-points for HbA 1c successfully stratify persons according to long-term risk regardless of black or white race and even after adjustment for known risk factors.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
"Consistent with our findings previous work also has shown that the associations of HbA 1c with microvascular outcomes including retinopathy do not differ by race/ethnicity (43,44).",Selvin_2013.txt,0
In fact blacks in the U.S. have a higher prevalence of retinopathy than whites in the U.S. at the same level of HbA 1c (45) even among persons without a history of diagnosed diabetes (46).,Selvin_2013.txt,0
Limitations of this study that should be considered in the interpretation of these results include the reliance on single measurements of HbA 1c and fasting glucose at baseline.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
Furthermore black participants were largely enrolled in the ARIC study at two of the field centersd Jackson Mississippi and Forsyth County North Carolina.,Selvin_2013.txt,0

This study benefited from the long-term follow-up rigorous measurement of known cardiovascular risk factors and the comprehensive surveillance for and validation of cardiovascular events.,Selvin_2013.txt,0
In conclusion our data suggest that HbA 1c is a more potent predictor of longterm outcomes than fasting glucose and that the associations with kidney disease and vascular outcomes are not significantly weaker in blacks compared with whites.,Selvin_2013.txt,0

METHODS -To conduct this study we utilized data from three large studies conducted in Singapore: the 1998 National Health Survey (NHS98) the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study and the Singapore CVD Cohort Study.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The NHS98 was a study conducted to determine the prevalence of risk factors for the major noncommunicable diseases in Singapore including diabetes CVD stroke and hypertension (12).,Tai_2004.txt,0
The two minority ethnic groups Malays and Asian Indians were oversampled to give an ethnic distribution of 64% Chinese 21% Malay and 15% Asian Indian to ensure sufficient numbers for statistical analysis.,Tai_2004.txt,0
"A total of 4,723 subjects were studied.",Tai_2004.txt,0
FPG was determined in all subjects in the morning following a 10-h fast.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Those who were not on oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,Tai_2004.txt,0
Only one measure of glucose tolerance was performed.,Tai_2004.txt,0
"In 1992 another cross-sectional sample comprising 3,568 subjects was selected and examined using identical methodology (13).",Tai_2004.txt,0
This was the 1992 National Health Survey (NHS92).,Tai_2004.txt,0
As in the NHS98 all subjects who were not on oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin underwent a 75-g OGTT in the morning on a single occasion following a 10-h fast.,Tai_2004.txt,0
A total of 469 subjects with IGT were identified in the NHS92.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In the year 2000 all subjects with IGT were frequency matched by strata of age sex and ethnic group with 468 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT).,Tai_2004.txt,0
The discrepancy of one subject arose due to the unavailability of sufficient Chinese women in the age range of 65-69 years with NGT.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Among the 937 NGT and IGT subjects selected 1 died 1 was mentally ill and 20 could not be traced.,Tai_2004.txt,0

In a manner identical to the baseline examination all subjects who were not on insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents underwent a 75-g OGTT following a 10-h fast on a single occasion.,Tai_2004.txt,0
These formed the study population for the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study (11).,Tai_2004.txt,0
"The Singapore CVD Cohort Study (14,15) was composed of participants from three previous cross-sectional surveys: the Thyroid and Heart Study 1982Study -1984 (16) (16) the NHS92 (described in the preceding paragraph) and the National University of Singapore Heart Study 1993-1995 (17).",Tai_2004.txt,0

The demographic characteristics of the participants of the three studies are presented in the supplemental Table 1 (online appendix [http://care.diabetesjournals.org]).,Tai_2004.txt,0
The study populations of the Thyroid and Heart Study and the NHS92 were similar in terms of age and the distribution of sex and ethnic groups.,Tai_2004.txt,0
However the National University of Singapore Heart Study population was older and had a greater proportion of Malays and Asian Indians.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Outcomes were obtained by linking individual records (using unique national registry identity card numbers) to three national registries.,Tai_2004.txt,0
These were: 1) the Registry of Births and Deaths; 2) the Central Claims Processing System and its predecessor the Hospital Inpatient Discharge System (these databases capture inpatient discharge information from all hospitals in Singapore both public and private); and 3) the Singapore Myocardial Infarct Registry a population-based registry with comprehensive coverage of acute myocardial infarction occurring in Singapore.,Tai_2004.txt,0
All obtained outcome measures were in coded form using the 9th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9).,Tai_2004.txt,0
An ischemic heart disease (IHD) event was defined as the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction or IHD (ICD-9 410-414) recorded in the aforementioned registries.,Tai_2004.txt,1
The first IHD event was used for analysis.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Subjects were censored as of 1 March 1999 or their date of event occurrence or death whichever occurred first.,Tai_2004.txt,0
This analysis excluded those with diabetes and preexisting IHD at baseline.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The assessment of glucose tolerance for the Thyroid Heart Study and the National University of Singapore Heart Study differed somewhat from that for the NHS92 and NHS98.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In both of the former studies FPG was determined in all subjects after a 10-h overnight fast.,Tai_2004.txt,0
However in the Thyroid Heart Study an OGTT was only performed in those with fasting glucose Ն6.0 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In the National University of Singapore Heart Study an OGTT was performed in those with FPG Ն5.5 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
These methods although reasonably effective for the identification of those with diabetes resulted in significant misclassification of those with IGT.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Therefore we utilized data from the entire cohort in the assessment of CVD risk associated with varying levels of FPG only.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We felt that these data were relevant because it reflects the clinical scenario in which the recommended test is the FPG evaluation and not an OGTT.,Tai_2004.txt,0
However we felt that it was also important to compare the predictive value of the FPG and 2-h PG tests and this was carried out by limiting the analysis to those subjects from the NHS92.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In this study all subjects had an OGTT.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In accordance with the American Diabetes Association (1) and World Health Organization (18) recommendations diabetes was diagnosed if the subject was taking medication for diabetes or if the FPG was Ն7.0 mmol/l or the 2-h PG Ն11.1 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
IGT was diagnosed if the FPG was Ͻ7.0 mmol/l and 2-h PG Ն7.8 mmol/l and Ͻ11.1 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
To assess the likelihood that those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l would already be steered toward lifestyle intervention for the prevention of CVD we estimated the prevalence of other features of the metabolic syndrome among this subgroup of the population using data from the NHS98.,Tai_2004.txt,0
For this purpose we utilized the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition for the metabolic syndrome (19) with one variation.,Tai_2004.txt,1
The waist circumference we used to identify those with central obesity was lowered from 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women to 90 cm in men and 80 cm in women.,Tai_2004.txt,1
This is in line with our recent work (20) showing that these cutoffs would be more appropriate when applied to an Asian population.,Tai_2004.txt,0

The analysis was performed with any hyperglycemia (diabetes or IGT) as the outcome and also with IGT as the outcome after excluding those with diabetes.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We carried out a similar analysis using the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In this instance the outcome was the presence of diabetes after 8 years of follow-up.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The impact of lowering the criterion for IFG from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l on the prevalence of IFG in Singapore was assessed using the NHS98 population.,Tai_2004.txt,1

"[The predictive power for CHD of the number of metabolic abnormalities was compared with the FRS equation 24,25 over 20 years.",Wannamethee_2008.txt,0

It is not surprising that the FRS is a better predictor of CHD as the metabolic syndrome does not contain several well-established risk factors for CHD such as serum total cholesterol and smoking.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
However the metabolic syndrome was a far better predictor of diabetes than the FRS.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
This is likely to be due to the inclusion of established risk factors for diabetes such as waist circumference (BMI) and high blood glucose levels (short of diabetes) which are not included in the FRS.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
Since CVD is more common than diabetes the FRS was a better discriminator and more sensitive in identifying total events (total CHD stroke or diabetes) than the metabolic syndrome (AUC 0.66 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.64-0.68 vs 0.60 0.58-0.62; Po0.001 sensitivity 41.2 vs 34.7%) but absolute risk of developing CVD or diabetes over 20 years in those with three or more metabolic abnormalities was very high ranging from 41.8 to 50.8% chance comparable with the absolute incidence rates in the top 2 fifths of the Framingham distribution over 20 years.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1

Furthermore thorough health checkup data at baseline allowed us more accurate adjustments for other cardiovascular risk factors.,Kim_2013.txt,0
A study conducted in China ( 14) also reported that IFG (FSG 100-125 mg/dL) was significantly associated with an increased 10-year risk of CVD CHD and ischemic stroke although they did not separately analyze FSG levels of 100-109 mg/dL (designated as grade 1 IFG in our study).,Kim_2013.txt,1
However hyperglycemia without any other metabolic syndrome component was not associated with increased risk of CVD suggesting that increased CVD risk in individuals with IFG or diabetes was largely driven by the coexistence of multiple metabolic disorders rather than hyperglycemia per se.,Kim_2013.txt,1
However only a small percentage of participants in their study exhibited IFG without other metabolic syndrome components.,Kim_2013.txt,0
In our results HRs were substantially lower after adjusting for multiple cardiovascular risk factors but remained significant.,Kim_2013.txt,0
Considerable evidence has shown that hyperglycemia induces inflammation oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction (4) and fibrinolytic and thrombotic processes that could destabilize an atherosclerotic plaque leading to eventual thrombosis and clinical CHD (12).,Kim_2013.txt,1
There has been considerable debate regarding whether the 2003 ADA definition of IFG (FSG 100-125 mg/dL) predicts the risk of CVD as well as the 1997 ADA definition of IFG (FSG 110-125 mg/dL).,Kim_2013.txt,1
A study conducted in Taiwan (13) reported that the 1997 definition of IFG was associated with a significant increase in mortality related to CVD and/or diabetes but that the 2003 definition of IFG did not have predictive value for CVD or diabetes mortality.,Kim_2013.txt,1
However this Taiwanese study did not report the relationship between IFG and incidence of CVD.,Kim_2013.txt,0
In a study of postmenopausal women in the U.S. (12) IFG according to the 1997 definition was associated with an increased risk for any CHD event but IFG according to the 2003 definition was not associated with increased risk.,Kim_2013.txt,1
However the study included only postmenopausal women with established CHD and the sample size was small; therefore it is difficult to generalize their results.,Kim_2013.txt,0
In contrast studies in China ( 14) and the U.S. (25) showed that IFG defined as FSG 100-125 mg/dL was associated with increased risk of CHD.,Kim_2013.txt,1
In the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies (18) a positive log-linear association was reported between FSG and the risk of total stroke and IHD.,Kim_2013.txt,0
Continuous positive associations were observed down to at least 4.9 mmol/L (88 mg/dL) without evidence of a threshold level.,Kim_2013.txt,0
A metaanalysis of previous studies (19) indicated that FPG showed a possible threshold effect at ;100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).,Kim_2013.txt,1
Although we did not analyze for a specific threshold level our results support the lower 2003 IFG cutoff point as a predictor of increased IHD risk.,Kim_2013.txt,1
In our study the increased risk for IHD associated with IFG persisted after adjusting for other conventional risk factors in men but not in women.,Kim_2013.txt,0
In contrast the Framingham Heart Study (17) reported that hyperglycemia was associated with a greater CVD risk in women than in men.,Kim_2013.txt,0
The meta-analysis ( 19) also reported that the relative risk for CVD was greater in cohorts that included women than in cohorts of men.,Kim_2013.txt,0
However few studies have examined this relationship in cohorts of women only.,Kim_2013.txt,0
"Although most Asian studies (13,14) did not analyze men and women separately the Asian Pacific Cohort Study (18) showed that fasting glucose in prediabetes and diabetes was an important determinant of CVD without a significant difference between men and women.",Kim_2013.txt,0
It is unclear that whether these discrepancies are due to ethnic differences or to differences in risk factor management between populations.,Kim_2013.txt,0
"Although diabetes is strongly associated with increased risk for stroke (27,28) less is known about the risk associated with prediabetic states.",Kim_2013.txt,0
In previous crosssectional (29) and longitudinal studies (12) IGT or IFG was not associated with risk of stroke.,Kim_2013.txt,0
"However many previous studies (12,17,18) did not perform separate analyses for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.",Kim_2013.txt,0
Our study showed that IFG was associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke but not hemorrhagic stroke which is consistent with results of a longitudinal study conducted in China (14).,Kim_2013.txt,0
However the association between IFG and risk of ischemic stroke appears weak compared with the association between IFG and IHD as increased risk of ischemic stroke was seen only in men with grade 2 IFG (FSG 110-125 mg/dL) after multivariate adjustment.,Kim_2013.txt,1
Our study has several limitations that must be acknowledged.,Kim_2013.txt,0
First results of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) were not available; therefore the 1997 and 2003 IFG definitions could not be Although it was more accurate than outpatient-based diagnosis there were possibilities of underestimation for the outcomes.,Kim_2013.txt,0
Finally although many important clinical and laboratory variables were adjusted for the risk analysis in this study several relevant factors such as use of lipidlowering drugs could not be adjusted properly because of incomplete data at baseline.,Kim_2013.txt,0
In conclusion our study showed that IFG defined as FPG levels of 100-125 mg/dL is associated with increased risk of CVD (including IHD and ischemic stroke) in the Korean population.,Kim_2013.txt,1
This association is independent of other conventional risk factors in men but not in women.,Kim_2013.txt,0
Further studies are needed to identify subgroups with IFG for whom prevention efforts in reducing cardiovascular events are cost-effective.,Kim_2013.txt,0

Coronary heart disease included cases of myocardial infarction stable and unstable angina pectoris and CHD death (15).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Cardiovascular disease was defined as any CHD event stroke transient ischemic attack (TIA) intermittent claudication congestive heart failure or CVD death.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Diabetes was defined as described previously in the previous section.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
A panel of 3 physicians reviewed each CHD and CVD event and adjudicated the end point according to pre-established criteria (16).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0

Three separate models were used to examine incident CHD and CVD: 1),Levitzky_2008.txt,0
To examine the impact of the 1997 IFG definition on CHD and CVD risk we compared FPG 110 to 125 mg/dl (6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l) to a referent group of FPG Ͻ110 mg/dl (Ͻ6.1 mmol/l).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1

3),Levitzky_2008.txt,0
To directly compare the categorization and performance of the 1997 and 2003 IFG definitions a multicategory model was created comparing both FPG 100 to 109 mg/dl (5.6 to 6.0 mmol/l) and 110 to 125 mg/dl (6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l) to a referent group of FPG Ͻ100 mg/dl (Ͻ5.6 mmol/l).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
This model ensured that the same referent group would be used to compare individuals in the 100 to 109 mg/dl category with those in the 110 to 125 mg/dl category.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
For analyses of diabetes prediction individuals with diabetes at each index examination were excluded and 3 similar models (1 to 3 as described in the previous paragraph) were constructed.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Age-adjusted incidence rates of CHD CVD and diabetes were calculated for each FPG group (17).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Pooled logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of developing CHD CVD or diabetes over the follow-up intervals using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Cary North Carolina) (18).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Pooled logistic regression has been shown to provide estimates similar to those generated from time-dependent Cox regression analysis (19).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Models were initially age-adjusted and then adjusted for covariates for each end point.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
To compare the predictive capacity of the 2003 versus 1997 IFG definition we examined the c-statistics of all multivariable models.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
The c-statistic is a measure of model discrimination or concordance between the predictions and outcomes (20).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Crude Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed using time to CVD stratified by glycemic category (FPG Ͻ100 mg/dl; 100 to 109 mg/dl; 110 to 125 mg/dl; diabetes).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
The study population consisted of non-institutionalized persons born in 1920 or earlier residing in the municipalities of Kempele Oulunsalo and Hailuoto in northern Finland.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The ethical committee of the Oulu University Hospital approved the study protocol.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The study was conducted between 1 September 1991 and 29 February 1992 in two phases.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The first phase consisted of a postal questionnaire and physical examination.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The second phase in early 1992 included a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
At the beginning of the first phase on 1 September 1991 there were 501 eligible persons (190 men) participating in the study and 444 persons (163 men) took part in one or both examination days during the first phase.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
At the beginning of the second phase on 1 January 1992 there were 487 persons (183 men) eligible for the study.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The change in subject number was because some subjects had died some had been admitted to institutional care and some had moved.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Four persons died before the second examination in 1992.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The total number of non-institutionalized persons eligible for the second examination was 483 (180 men 303 women).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Of these people 83 (31 men) refused to take part and 21 (8 men) did not have their 2 h glucose values determined due to medical or other reasons.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The total number of participants in this study was thus 379 (141 men) and the participation rate was 78.5% (78.3% among men and 78.5% among women).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Three hundred and thirty-six persons underwent the 2 h glucose tolerance test while the remaining 43 had diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycaemic drugs or insulin.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Therefore only fasting capillary whole blood glucose was determined for those patients.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"""The first phase of the study consisted of a postal questionnaire including questions about the participants previously diagnosed diabetes.",Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The physical examination comprised measurements of body height and weight and an evaluation of signs of previous stroke.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The physical examinations were preformed by a nurse and a physician respectively.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Height and weight were measured in light indoor clothing without shoes.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m 2 ).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was considered to be present if the participant took medication for coronary heart disease and/or had signs of a previous stroke.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
Information about the medication for coronary heart disease was derived from the codes printed on the subjects medication (including long-acting nitrates sublingual nitrates and beta blockers).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The diagnosis of hypertension was derived from health insurance records and from questionnaire information identifying subjects who did not receive medication free of charge or subjects who were not on medication.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The frequency and strenuousness of physical exercise were measured by a question with seven alternative answers.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
These were dichotomized into two categories in the analysis.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The two categories were described as follows: 1: inactive (no exercise or no more exercise than going shopping or participating in other light activity once or twice a week); 2: active (walking or corresponding exercise many times a week to exercising many times a week causing much sweating and breathlessness during the exercise).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
Smoking was assessed using one question: 1: no 2: yes.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Self-perceived health was assessed by one question with five alternatives: 1: very good 2: rather good 3: moderate 4: rather poor 5: very poor.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1

The corresponding WHO 1999 criteria for diabetes are as follows: fasting whole blood glucose values 6.1 mmol/l and/or 2 h OGTT values 11.1 mmol/ l. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined by 2 h OGTT values from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/l according to both criteria and persons with 2 h OGTT values <7.8 mmol/l are classified as having normal glucose tolerance [13].,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
The WHO 1999 criteria additionally include the category of impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) which is defined as fasting blood glucose values of 5.6-6.0 mmol/l.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
In this study a person was classified as having previously diagnosed diabetes if he/she took an oral drug or insulin treatment or if he/she was on a diabetes diet and additionally had a new OGTT 2 h value 11.1 mmol/l.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
The latter was done because after checking medical records patient-reported diagnosis of diet-treated diabetes was found to include some persons who actually had nearnormal fasting values or IGT so called pre-diabetes which was a term in general use and was easily confused with diabetes in the 1980s.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
A person without previously diagnosed diabetes was classified as having previously undiagnosed diabetes if the 2 h OGTT showed a value of 11.1 mmol/l and impaired glucose tolerance if the 2 h value was 7.8-11.0 mmol/l.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
Those with 2 h OGTT values <7.8 mmol/l and not on an oral diabetes treatment drug or insulin treatment were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1

Measures of overall model fit model discrimination reclassification and model calibration were assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Model fit was assessed by the likelihood ratio (LR) test and Akaikes information criterion (AIC).,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Whereas the LR usually increases with the addition of variables to a risk score the AIC is reduced by the addition of variables that do not substantially increase the model fit.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Ultimately the model with the lowest AIC is the best.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Discrimination of the models was compared on the basis of the AUCs of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) graphs (synonymous to the c-statistic).,Schottker_2013.txt,0
However the AUC has limitations in the detection of an improvement of a risk score by an additional biomarker even if it is strongly associated with the disease [17].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Therefore the net reclassification improvement (NRI) by adding FPG or HbA 1c was calculated [16] according to the recommended 10 year riskprediction strata: 0-5% >5-10% >10-20% and >20% of predicted probability for a cardiovascular event [17].,Schottker_2013.txt,1
For an improved net reclassification adding FPG or HbA 1c to a cardiovascular risk score should lead to more cases that move up in risk category than cases that move down and if possible also to more controls that move down in risk category than controls that move up.,Schottker_2013.txt,0

"Contrary to the consensus statement previously reported (2,3) IFG is more than just a risk marker for future diabetes.",Wen_2005.txt,1
First anyone with FBG Ն110 mg/dl (Table 3) was shown to have substantially increased risks for all-cause and CVD mortality with excess risks as much as 140% for CVD and diabetes.,Wen_2005.txt,1
Second IFG per se caused higher mortality for CVD and/or diabetes (Table 2).,Wen_2005.txt,0
Obviously these individuals were indeed vulnerable not only because they tended to be associated with additional CVD risk profiles but also because they had an ad-ditional unique independent risk in hav-FBG at 110 -125 mg/dl.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"Thus a simple blood test to uncover IFG can predict substantial mortality risks for CVD and diabetes among nondiabetic individuals hitherto vaguely recognized (2,15,17,(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29).",Wen_2005.txt,0
"The failure of previous studies to identify such risks may have come more from the inadequate sample size of study cohorts than from a true absence of risks (15,17,18,(23)(24)(25)(26)(27).",Wen_2005.txt,0
The excess risks of IFG were demonstrated within 11 years a relatively short time implying that an urgency exists for preventive actions in those with IFG.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"In the meantime a mechanism to identify those in the high-risk IFG group and to retard the progression of IFG should be pursued (2,14).",Wen_2005.txt,0
"The recent designation of smoking as ""a chronic addictive disease"" (42) has facilitated the implementation of smoking cessation programs in the clinical setting.",Wen_2005.txt,1
Similarly making IFG a treatable condition or recognizing it as a disease would legitimize early intervention.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"It should be emphasized that much of the intervention for IFG is to institute sustainable lifestyle changes (43,44).",Wen_2005.txt,0
Even though the results in this study came from a cohort with higher education the increased risks of IFG seen in this study can be a reasonable estimate for those in the general population because risk estimation was based on internal comparison with persons with similar socioeconomic status.,Wen_2005.txt,0
Some practices in this study resulted in consistent quality: collecting a history and examining subjects under one protocol from one single clinic and analyzing blood samples in the same laboratory with the same machine by the same trained staffs using the same methodology.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"The independently increased risk of IFG found in this study is in contrast to results of published reports of IFG based mostly on pooled studies (19,23,26,28,37,45,46) which are affected by inconsistent quality or wide variations including  differences in the age or morbidity distribution of subcohorts.",Wen_2005.txt,0
The cut point for our reference group FBG 90 -109 mg/dl was selected because of its lowest risk in our study subjects.,Wen_2005.txt,1
An identical cut point was chosen by de Vegt et al. (15) and by the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration (19).,Wen_2005.txt,1
This is because given the J-shaped relationship of FBG with mortality risk lower levels of glucose carried some adverse risks in this and other studies.,Wen_2005.txt,0
In fact similar observations were made by the DECODE group which reported the lowest mortality risks in subjects with FPG at 4.5-5.0 mmol/l (80 -90 mg/dl) for all-cause mortality or 5.0 -5.5 mmol/l (90 -100 mg/dl) for CVD mortality (37) and by Balkau et al. (38) who also concluded that the lowest mortality rate was seen among subjects in the group with FBG 5.25-5.75 mmol/l (95-104 mg/dl).,Wen_2005.txt,0
All of these data indicate that the inclusion of any group with FBG Ͻ90 mg/dl may not be the best reference group.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"Although IFG was reportedly less sensitive in its predictive value for diabetes or CVD than was IGT (2,23,24,26) FBG has been universally recognized as a preferred mode of diabetes screening with the test being easier to perform more convenient and acceptable to patients more reproducible and most importantly less expensive (47).",Wen_2005.txt,0
These advantages are further magnified in Asian populations particularly because the cost of screening has always been an overriding concern.,Wen_2005.txt,0
"Most studies examining the mortality outcome of high blood glucose have focused mainly on deaths from CVD and not from diabetes (2,21,(23)(24)(25)(26)29,41) but in our study mortality from diabetes as an additional end point was included.",Wen_2005.txt,0
First as shown in this cohort a strong association between various glucose levels and subsequent deaths coded to diabetes supports their causal relationships: RR as large as 4.3 for 110 -125 mg/dl 22.6 for 126 -139 mg/dl 21.2 for 140 -179 mg/dl and 125.6 for Ն180 mg/dl (Table 2).,Wen_2005.txt,1
Second more deaths were coded to diabetes in Taiwan than elsewhere: Diabetes ranked as the fourth leading cause of deaths in Taiwan and constituted 7.7% of all deaths (48).,Wen_2005.txt,0
"This proportion was far larger than its counterparts in the U.S. of 3.0% (49,50) or in Japan of 1.3% (51) even though the prevalence of diabetes in Taiwan was not much higher (52).",Wen_2005.txt,0
"age-adjusted mortality rates 57.7 and 74.0 for men and for women in Taiwan (48) were more than twice as large than those in the U.S. (28.6 and 23.0) (49,50) or 6 -10 times larger than those in Japan (9.1 and 5.9 per 100,000) (51) respectively.",Wen_2005.txt,0
This gap between Taiwan and the U.S. or Japan has been widening because the mortality rate for diabetes in Taiwan has been rapidly increasing (53).,Wen_2005.txt,0
"This higher proportion of deaths from diabetes has been shown not to be due to a coding artifact (53,54) or to a true increase in the prevalence of diabetes (52) but is more reflective of the preference by physicians in assigning diabetes as the underlying cause of death when filling out death certificates.",Wen_2005.txt,0
Based on these considerations we felt these deaths coded to diabetes should be considered along with CVD deaths in accounting for all diabetes-related deaths.,Wen_2005.txt,0
This study shows that the new ADA criteria for IFG defining IFG as 100 -125 mg/dl instead of as 110 -125 mg/dl have substantially weakened the predictive power of mortality outcome.,Wen_2005.txt,1
By including the 100 -109 mg/dl group the new IFG criteria quadrupled the number of subjects in this cohort from 7.8% to 24.0%.,Wen_2005.txt,1
However this inclusion was found to produce almost no increase in mortality risks.,Wen_2005.txt,0
As the new population with IFG becomes statistically not different from those with IFG below this level mainly because of the inclusion of this 100 -109 mg/dl group the new definition of IFG cannot be justified from the mortality perspective.,Wen_2005.txt,1
In summary there was an overall Jshaped relationship between all-cause mortality and FBG.,Wen_2005.txt,0
IFG traditionally defined as 110 -125 mg/dl is an independ e n t r i s k f a c t o r a n d s h o u l d b e aggressively treated as a disease because it produced a significant increase in combined CVD and diabetes mortality risks in this Asian population.,Wen_2005.txt,1
The increase in risk and the predictive value of IFG disappeared when IFG was defined as 100 -125 mg/dl making the necessity of the new IFG definition questionable.,Wen_2005.txt,1

1 In the absence of weight loss polyuria polydipsia and a blood glucose concentration 2 h after load of at least 1 1 • 1 mmol/L these new criteria rely primarily on fasting glucose values.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
The advantage of the ADA criteria is that they do not require oral glucose tolerance testing with 2 h glucose measurements as set forth by the WHO criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
2 By simplifying the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus ADA hoped that the diagnosis of glucose metabolic disturbances would be simpler and less of a burden to patients more readily accepted by the medical community and would lead to earlier detection and treatment of individuals with diabetes mellitus.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
The fasting ADA criteria establish a fasting glucose concentration of at least 7•0 mmol/L for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus which is lower than the corresponding WHO criteria of at least 7•8 mmol/L.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
This lower cut-off point was chosen because the microvascular eye and kidney diseases that are unique to diabetes mellitus begin to become more prevalent at this concentration.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
The fasting ADA criteria also define a new class of glucose disturbance called impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose 6 • 1 -6 • 9 mmol/L) which differs from the WHO category of impaired glucose tolerance (fasting glucose <7•8 mmol/L and 2 h glucose у7•8 mmol/L and <11•1 mmol/L).,Barzilay_1999.txt,1

As shown in Table 3 IGT was associated with increased risk for stroke (HR 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.24) but not for CHD (1.21 0.69-2.13) whereas diabetes was significantly associated with CHD (P = .010) and CVD (P = .017).,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
Association of IGT with increased risk for CVD was marginal (P = .054) (Table 3).,Oizumi_2008.txt,0

[As shown in Fig. 1B at the end of the follow-up the cumulative incidences of CVD stroke and CHD for IFG (0.110 0.091 and 0.034 respectively) were not significantly higher than those for NGT (0.101 0.069 and 0.022 respectively).,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Furthermore,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Cox proportional hazard model analyses with age sex and the presence of hypertension as the covariables did not show the risk of IFG for CVD (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.52-1.50) stroke (1.11 0.61-2.02) and CHD (0.50 0.16-1.60).,Oizumi_2008.txt,0

Diagnosed DM was independently and significantly associated with the development of CVD (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.12-3.32) in model 2. Because prevalence of hypertension has reached as high as 51.8% in our population we have further assessed the association of 3 categories of blood glucose (NGR IGR and DM) with the risk of major outcomes among participants stratified according to the presence or absence of hypertension (−IGR/−HBP [reference],Qiu_2015.txt,1
As expected coexistence of DM and hypertension was associated with the most significant increases in the incidences of both DM and CVD compared with the reference group.,Qiu_2015.txt,1
Table 3 depicts the adjusted OR and 95% CI for DM and CVD according to blood glucose and blood pressure.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Isolated IGR was not associated with elevated CVD risk in the adjusted models (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.47-2.58); however IGR and hypertension in the same individual considerably increased the risk for developing both CVD and DM when compared with the reference group with adjusted OR of 2.41 (95% CI 1.25-4.64) for CVD and 6.37 (95% CI 3.41-11.89) for DM. Isolated DM increased CVD risk for 2.72 times (95% CI 1.03-7.14) and a DM and hypertension combined state was even higher up to 3.43 times (95% CI 1.66-7.11) compared with -IGR/-HBP group.,Qiu_2015.txt,1

CONCLUSIONS,Magliano_2010.txt,0
-With the current high prevalence of diabetes and the predicted dramatic increase in the number of individuals with diabetes in many developing nations studies of outcomes of diabetes particularly morbidity and mortality become of prime importance.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
This study is one of the first to examine the impact of diabetes on all-cause and CVD mortality over the long term in a developing nation.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
We showed that there was a greater impact of diabetes on all-cause and CVD mortality among South Asians than among Africans.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
All-cause mortality risk in those with KDM compared with that in those with NGT was approximately doubled in Africans and in-Figure 1-Adjusted all-cause (A) and CVD (B) mortality HRs (95% CIs) for IFG IGT NDM and KDM compared with NGT according to ethnic group.,Magliano_2010.txt,0

Furthermore there was an ϳ40 -50% increased mortality from CVD and all causes for South Asians with IGT whereas in Africans with IGT mortality was not significantly increased.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Mortality in individuals with IFG was not increased in any ethnic showed that 62% of all CVD deaths occurred in individuals with abnormal glucose regulation (KDM NDM IFG or IGT) at baseline.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Of all deaths ϳ15-17% of all deaths were attributed to diabetes (KDM and NDM).,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Many studies have demonstrated that diabetes is an important risk factor for both all-cause and CVD mortality in Europid populations (11)(12)(13).,Magliano_2010.txt,1
There are also studies of individuals of African origin living in developed countries.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
The Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry Study showed that among 666 African American men both asymptomatic and clinical diabetes were associated with an increased risk of death with relative risks of 1.37 (95% CI 0.85-2.20) and 1.78 (0.97-3.25) after adjustment for conventional risk factors over a period of 22 years (11).,Magliano_2010.txt,1
In another study of Africans from Barbados those with diabetes had a HR for all-cause and CVD mortality of 1.80 (95% CI 1.53-2.11) and 2.10 (1.69 -2.59) respectively over a follow-up period of 9 years (14).,Magliano_2010.txt,1
There are however no data about diabetes and mortality in Africans living in developing countries.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
In the DECODA study the HR for KDM for Asians of 3.22 (2.50 -4.14) was similar to our estimate for South Asians and Chinese (4).,Magliano_2010.txt,0
DECODA in-cludes data from a shorter follow-up (5 years) of Mauritians from our study population.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
In the Asia Pacific Cohort Collaboration a pooling project that includes studies from Southeast Asia (Japan Hong Kong Taiwan Korea and China) New Zealand and Australia the HRs associated with diabetes for all-cause mortality for south-east Asians and non Asians were 1.62 and 1.76 lower than our estimates (15).,Magliano_2010.txt,0
"Our findings that IGT but not IFG is associated with an increased risk of mortality are consistent with several studies (2,4,16).",Magliano_2010.txt,1
"The Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE) and DECODA studies have demonstrated that when 2-h plasma glucose elevation is controlled for fasting glucose within the nondiabetic range is not associated with increased mortality (2,4).",Magliano_2010.txt,1
Contrasting findings include those of Coutinho et al. (16) who showed that IFG was significantly associated with fatal and nonfatal CVD events but were unable to separate IFG from diabetes and IGT based on 2-h plasma glucose.,Magliano_2010.txt,1
Barr et al. (3) showed that IGT was associated with all-cause but not CVD mortality and that IFG predicted all-cause and CVD mortality but the follow-up was only 5 years.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
We found no evidence of an impact of IFG on all-cause or CVD mortality in any ethnic group.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
The reasons for the discrepancy among study findings is not known but could be due to differences in the populations studied the study design or the length of follow-up.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
The proportion of all deaths contrib-uted to by diabetes (KDM and NDM) of 15% in men and 17% in women in this study is higher than has been reported in other studies.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
In the Asia Pacific Cohort Collaboration the overall population attributable fraction of diabetes ranged from 2.3 to 12.2% for coronary heart disease and was reported to be 6% for allcause mortality in Thailand (17).,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Our figure of 15-17% highlights the possible benefit of initiating lifestyle-based or pharmaceutical intervention especially in the light of recent evidence of the efficacy of lifestyle intervention for diabetes (18 -20).,Magliano_2010.txt,0
"Several studies have shown that abnormal glucose metabolism is present in approximately two-thirds of patients with acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease (3,21,22).",Magliano_2010.txt,1
In the current analysis we have shown that 62% of all CVD deaths occurred in those with either diabetes IFG or IGT at baseline.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
This finding suggests that the public health benefits of targeting CVD prevention for those with pre-diabetes and the early stages of type 2 diabetes would probably be of great benefit.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
"Such strategies are underpinned by evidence from trials (18,20,23).",Magliano_2010.txt,0
The strengths of this study include a large national population-based sample with excellent response rates and an extremely low loss to follow-up of 8.6%.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Sensitivity analyses which assumed that all participants who were lost to follow-up were alive at the last day of mortality ascertainment showed that the HR for all-cause mortality across the spec- trum of categories of glucose intolerance differed little from the point estimates of the primary analyses indicating the robustness of the findings of this study.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
This study is not without limitations.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Cause of death was ascertained by death certificates hospital records and next of kin.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Further in Mauritius information on death certificates was not ICD9 or ICD10 coded and was not available electronically before 2005; thus ICD codes were unavailable for this study.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Instead causes of death were coded into broad categories based on the text written on death certificates.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
It is possible that some misclassification has occurred.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
It is important to note that this limitation only affects the CVD mortality data and not the all-cause mortality data.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
However adjudication of cause of death of 19% of deaths using hospital records compared with text on the death certificate showed good agreement.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Furthermore in sensitivity analyses the CVD findings are not materially changed when cause of death coding was based on the death certificate or information on the certified extract of death.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Finally the small number of Chinese participants limits our ability to provide any certainty regarding the HR estimates for this ethnic group.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
impact of diabetes on all-cause and CVD mortality in South Asians and Africans living in a developing country is just as large as it is in the developed world.,Magliano_2010.txt,0
Health policy and planning agencies in developing countries need to recognize and plan for the rapid emergence and escalation of noncommunicable diseases especially diabetes and CVD with the latter likely to be as important a component of the disease spectrum in developing countries as it is in developed countries.,Magliano_2010.txt,0

When the HR of mortality was analyzed according to baseline glycemic status compared with subjects without diabetes those with diabetes at baseline showed 1.6-fold increased mortality risk after adjustment for multiple risk factors (Table 2).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
When the mortality risk was analyzed according to baseline glycemic status compared with normoglycemic subjects subjects with IFG showed weak but significantly increased risk for mortality.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Compared with normoglycemic subjects subjects with newly developed diabetes showed 1.44-fold increased mortality risk and the mortality risk gradually increased up to 1.77-fold as the duration of diabetes lengthened to ≥5 years (Table 2).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Similar findings were observed when the analyses were performed separately in a different sex.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
To evaluate the effect of various diseases in association with diabetes on mortality risk separate analyses were performed based on the presence and absence of various diseases and risk factors in association with diabetes (Table 3 Supplemental Table S1).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
The mortality risk was consistently higher in subjects with diabetes than in those without diabetes although the subjects had ischemic heart disease or ischemic stroke (Table 3 Figure 1).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
The mortality risk gradually increased when eGFR of the subjects decreased from normal to <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Subjects with diabetes and eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m,Rhee_2020.txt,0
2 had the highest mortality risk among the subjects divided on the basis of eGFR (3.385 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.292-3.481) and this risk was the highest among the risks calculated for various diseases and risk factors associated with diabetes suggesting that decreased renal function was the strongest risk factor to cause mortality in subjects with diabetes (Table 3 Figure 1).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
The subjects had an increased mortality risk when they currently smoked did not exercise or had abdominal obesity and these risks were higher when the subjects had diabetes than when they did not.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Interestingly compared with subjects with normal weight those who were underweight showed significantly increased mortality risk and this finding was also prominent in those with diabetes with underweight diabetes subjects showing 2.3-fold increased mortality risk compared with non-diabetes normal weight subjects (Table 3).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Similar results were observed when these analyses were performed in different sexes (Supplementary Table S1).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
When the above analyses were performed in different age groups somewhat different trends were observed (Supplementary Table S2).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
In the age group of 20-39 years the highest mortality risk was observed in those who had ischemic stroke and diabetes among the various diseases and risk factors (4.266 95% CI 1.604-11.349).,Rhee_2020.txt,0
However in the age group of ≥65 years those who had eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m,Rhee_2020.txt,0

For coronary heart disease and stroke the relationships with fasting glucose appeared monotonic.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
For heart failure combined CVD and all-cause mortality a slight J-shape was visible although the confidence intervals at the lower range of fasting glucose were very wide (Fig. 1A).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
This J-shape was no longer apparent and the curve in the upper range was attenuated when participants treated with diabetes medications were excluded (Fig. 1B).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Supplemental Fig. 1 shows separation of the survival curves for fasting glucose in the normal impaired and diabetic ranges across all CVD events and mortality but overlapping curves and confidence intervals for low and normal fasting glucose.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
For heart failure only survival was consistently but nonsignificantly lower for fasting glucose in the low category compared to normal.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Cox proportional survival models revealed a significantly increased risk for all CVD events and all-cause mortality in participants with impaired and high fasting glucose compared to those with fasting glucose in the normal range (Table 2).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
The hazard ratios remained significant throughout adjustment.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Compared to participants with normal glucose levels low fasting glucose was associated with nonsignificant trends toward reduced risk of coronary heart disease and stroke but higher heart failure risk.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,1
The only significant hazard ratios were for coronary heart disease and these associations were attenuated with adjustment for cholesterol blood pressure body mass index smoking and diabetes treatment.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Relative to normal glucose low fasting glucose was not associated with combined CVD or all-cause mortality.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
While estimates for heart failure were higher for low fasting glucose compared to the normal range these estimates were not significant (Table 2).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Inclusion of other CVD risk factors strengthened the estimate for the low fasting glucose group but adjustment for diabetes treatment strongly attenuated all heart failure estimates especially for the diabetic category.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Failure to see such attenuation in the low or impaired fasting glucose categories may be explained by the higher level of diabetes treatment in the highest fasting glucose category (182 participants compared to 56 in the low category and 28 in the impaired category).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Additional adjustment for physical activity produced similar results (data not shown).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Statistically significant heterogeneity by age (< 70 and ≥ 70 years) was observed for stroke and heart failure but not coronary heart disease all-cause CVD or mortality (Table 3).,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
For stroke there was a significant inverse association for those < 70 years of age but a non-significant positive association for those ≥ 70.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
For heart failure the subgroup results by age were the reverse of that for stroke.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0

However in participants with normal FPG no significant association of elevated HbA 1c with mortality was found although the nonsignificant association with CVD mortality could be due to a small number of participants (HR 2.02; 95% CI 0.83-4.93) (Table 4).,Jiang_2020.txt,0

When ROC analysis was applied to the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study the ideal level of FPG to predict future diabetes was also 5.6 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Based on data from the NHS98 the lowering of the diagnostic criterion increased the prevalence of IFG from 9.5% (95% CI 8.7-10.3) to 32.3% (31.0 -33.6).,Tai_2004.txt,0
In comparison the prevalence of IGT was 13.3% (12.3-14.2).,Tai_2004.txt,0
IFG irrespective of the definition used did not identify the same individuals as IGT (Table 1).,Tai_2004.txt,1
Only 28.8% of those with IGT had FGP 6.1-6.9 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
This was increased to 64% by lowering the criterion for IFG from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
However this new definition also included a large number of subjects with normal 2-h PG.,Tai_2004.txt,1
One hundred eighteen subjects in the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study had diabetes at the follow-up examination in 2000 8 years after the initial examination in 1992 (Table 2).,Tai_2004.txt,0
Those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l at baseline were at increased risk of diabetes even after adjustment for age sex and ethnic group.,Tai_2004.txt,1
However the risk was lower than that for those with FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l (odds ratio 55.1 vs. 12.4).,Tai_2004.txt,0
In addition the risk of diabetes was not homogenous within each category of FPG.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Those with IGT had higher risk than those without IGT within each category of FPG.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Furthermore even among subjects with FPG Ͻ5.6 mmol/l those with IGT were at greater risk of diabetes than those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l and without IGT.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We also estimated the risk of IHD in the Singapore CVD cohort for each category of glucose intolerance.,Tai_2004.txt,0
First we determined the risk of IHD associated with glucose tolerance as determined by FPG alone.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Table 3 shows the age and the IHD risk associated with each category of FPG.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Subjects with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l were younger than those with FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
To assess the effect of age on the risk of IHD associated with FPG analyses were carried out before and after adjustment for age.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Compared with those with FPG Ͻ5.6 mmol/l subjects with FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l were at increased risk of IHD.,Tai_2004.txt,1
Those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l exhibited an intermediate level of risk.,Tai_2004.txt,0
As with the risk of diabetes significant heterogeneity was present within each category of FPG (Table 4).,Tai_2004.txt,0
Based on data from the NHS92 those with IGT were at higher risk of IHD events irrespective of FPG category even in those with FPG Ͻ5.6 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Finally we found that the majority of subjects in the NHS98 who had FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l also exhibited other features of the metabolic syndrome (Table 5).,Tai_2004.txt,1
At least one feature of the metabolic syndrome other than glucose intolerance was observed in 63.5% of subjects with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
Central obesity high plasma triglycerides and high blood pressure were the most common abnormalities detected.,Tai_2004.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS,Tai_2004.txt,0
-In the follow-up report on the diagnosis of diabetes the American Diabetes Association cites epidemiologic data suggesting that using the 1997 definitions IFG did not connote the same degree of risk of diabetes or CVD as IGT.,Tai_2004.txt,1
These differences in predictive abilities represented an area of concern that the expert committee felt could be addressed by lowering the cut point for the diagnosis of IFG from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In line with these recommendations our study has found that statistically speaking an FPG of 5.6 mmol/l represents an appropriate cutoff for the Singapore population (supplemental Fig. 1 [online appendix]).,Tai_2004.txt,1
First adopting this cutoff would enhance the identification of those with IGT (Table 1).,Tai_2004.txt,0
The identification of individuals with IGT is desirable now that several randomized controlled trials have shown significant reduction in the risk of diabetes following interventions using lifestyle measures or drug therapy in those with IGT (21)(22)(23)(24).,Tai_2004.txt,1
Second in line with the findings in the U.S. ( 6) and in Mauritius (25) lowering the FPG criterion to 5.6 mmol/l identified a greater number of individuals at risk for future diabetes (Table 2).,Tai_2004.txt,1
In further support of the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association to lower the FPG criterion for diagnosis IFG from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l we have shown that an FPG of 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l is associated with increased risk of diabetes (Table 2) and IHD (Table 3).,Tai_2004.txt,1
Although it is true that those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l were at increased risk of diabetes and IHD our data suggest that this increased risk resided primarily within the subgroup that also had IGT (Tables 2 and 4).,Tai_2004.txt,1
The odds ratio for diabetes in those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l and 2-h PG Ͻ7.8 mmol/l was lower than that in those with IGT irrespective of FPG category.,Tai_2004.txt,1
The situation was similar in relation to IHD.,Tai_2004.txt,0
"As in previous studies (2,3) those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 were at increased risk of IHD (Table 3).",Tai_2004.txt,1
However within this category no increased risk was detected in those with 2-h PG Ͻ7.8 mmol/l whereas those with IGT were at substantially increased risk of IHD (Table 4).,Tai_2004.txt,0
In fact IGT was associated with a greater risk of both diabetes and IHD even when the FPG was Ͻ5.6 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
Thus lowering the FPG criteria to 5.6 mmol/l did not make IFG equivalent to IGT as a predictor of future disease.,Tai_2004.txt,1
In addition to the different predictive values for diabetes and CVD IFG and IGT also differ in terms of the individuals identified.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Lowering the diagnostic crite-  rion does not make IFG any more equivalent in this regard either.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Although the new criteria doubled the number of those with IGT detected (Table 1) it identified an even larger group of individuals with 2-h PG Ͻ7.8 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
These latter individuals are at relatively low risk of diabetes and IHD and among those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l outnumber those at high risk (IGT) by a factor of four to one (Table 1).,Tai_2004.txt,0
For this reason the lowering of the criterion of IFG lowers the CVD risk associated with this category of glucose intolerance.,Tai_2004.txt,1
It has also been suggested that lowering the IFG criterion brings a larger proportion of younger individuals into the IFG population thereby lowering the predictive nature of IFG for development of IHD.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Our data support that hypothesis.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Subjects with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l were younger than those with FPG 6.1-6.9 (Table 3).,Tai_2004.txt,1
"We need to bear in mind that a cut point that is statistically ""ideal"" may not be optimal from a public health point of view.",Tai_2004.txt,0
The assessment of the public health benefits of lowering the criterion for FPG needs to take into account the benefits or harm that may accrue from such a change.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Unfortunately the data to make such an assessment are not currently available.,Tai_2004.txt,0
All subjects in existing randomized controlled trials for diabetes prevention had IGT (21)(22)(23)(24).,Tai_2004.txt,0
Thus there is currently no evidence to suggest that effective prevention of diabetes is available for those with FPG 5.6 -6.9 mmol/l and normal 2-h PG.,Tai_2004.txt,0
These represent the majority of those diagnosed with IFG under the new definition.,Tai_2004.txt,1
It has also been suggested that many of the individuals with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l may already have a reason to modify their lifestyle due to the presence of other CVD risk factors (8).,Tai_2004.txt,1
In our study 63.5% of those with FPG between 5.6 and 6.0 mmol/l exhibited at least one other feature of the metabolic syndrome (Table 5) which would have been sufficient reason for therapeutic lifestyle modification.,Tai_2004.txt,1
There is no evidence that adding the label of IFG to the existing risk factors will enhance their adherence to a healthy lifestyle.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Even if it could be shown that intensive lifestyle modification prevented diabetes in those with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l as effectively as it does in those with IGT the cost of intensive lifestyle modification for such a large proportion of the population may be prohibitive for less economically developed countries.,Tai_2004.txt,0
To illustrate this we have utilized data from this study and from the lifestyle modification arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program (23).,Tai_2004.txt,0
In the latter study the relative risk reduction for diabetes over the 3 years of the study among those with IGT was 58% compared with the placebo group.,Tai_2004.txt,0
In the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study 35.1% of those with IGT developed diabetes over 8 years (11).,Tai_2004.txt,0
If we assume a constant rate of conversion over the 8 years this amounts to a cumulative incidence of 13.2% over 3 years (the duration of intervention in the Diabetes Prevention Program).,Tai_2004.txt,0
With a relative risk reduction of 58% the absolute risk reduction would be 7.66% and number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of diabetes would be 13.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We compared these estimates with those for subjects with FPG 5.6 -6.0 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Within this range of FPG 3.6% of those with normal 2-h PG and 11.7% of those with IGT would develop diabetes over 3 years (Table 2).,Tai_2004.txt,0
The absolute risk reductions associated with lifestyle modification assuming similar efficacy as in those with IGT would be 2.1% (NNT ϭ 48) and 6.8% (NNT ϭ 15) respectively.,Tai_2004.txt,0
"The number of individuals aged 20 -69 years (a similar age distribution of the NHS98 study population) and residing in Singapore was 2,202,647 in the year 2000 (data from the Singapore Department of Statistics www.singstat. gov.sg accessed 15 March 2004).",Tai_2004.txt,0
From the NHS98 we estimated that 13.3% of  In addition to the public health implications concerns have also been expressed with regard to the impact of these changes at an individual level.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The psychological impact of diagnosing a subject with IFG when he or she was previously considered normal is not known.,Tai_2004.txt,0
As pointed out by Davidson et al. (7) there is the added potential that insurance companies could raise life insurance premiums or medical insurance premiums for these individuals.,Tai_2004.txt,0
To have such a large proportion of the population diagnosed as having abnormal glucose tolerance would also put considerable strain on public health systems.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Our study has several limitations.,Tai_2004.txt,0
First glucose tolerance was determined on only one occasion.,Tai_2004.txt,0
This could lead to misclassification of glucose tolerance.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We believe that such misclassification would affect all categories of glucose tolerance equally.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Such nondifferential misclassification could reduce the absolute measures of risk associated with the various categories of glucose tolerance.,Tai_2004.txt,0
However it should not alter the conclusions that we have drawn.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Second the ascertainment of IHD events in the Singapore CVD cohort was carried out using data from several registries which could be unreliable.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We are currently unable to provide direct evidence as to the reliability of the registry data.,Tai_2004.txt,0
However we can say that data from the myocardial infarction registry were derived using the World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants of CVD (MONICA) protocol.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The methodology is therefore well established.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Furthermore submissions to the Central Claims Processing System and its predecessor the Hospital Inpatient Discharge System are regulatory requirements for all hospitals in Singapore and most if not all hospital admissions are represented.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The discharge diagnoses are completed by doctors directly involved in the management of the patients admitted to the hospital and we believe that they are reasonably accurate.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We concede that patients who are overseas at the time of their IHD event would be missed.,Tai_2004.txt,0
However our own experience as clinicians suggests that these would be small in number.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Third the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study was not a representative sample of the Singapore population.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Specifically those with NGT in the study were older than those with NGT in the general population due to the matching process.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The mean age of those with FPG 5.6 -6.9 selected as control subjects in the Singapore IGT Follow-up Study was 47 years whereas the mean age for those with the same level of FPG was 42 years in the entire NHS92 (data not shown).,Tai_2004.txt,0
Given that the risk of diabetes increases with age it is likely that our study overestimates the risk of diabetes associated with IFG.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Therefore the odds ratio for future diabetes in those with IFG is likely to be even lower than that found in our study supporting our conclusions that IFG is associated with a lower risk of diabetes than IGT.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The greater reproducibility of the FPG compared with the 2-h PG is one of the reasons the FPG has been favored for the diagnosis of glucose intolerance.,Tai_2004.txt,0
However the presence of IGT connoted a greater risk of diabetes and IHD than IFG.,Tai_2004.txt,1
Unfortunately lowering the criterion for IFG from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l did not seem to improve the predictive value of IFG in our population.,Tai_2004.txt,1
Based on the findings in this study one could argue that our focus should be to identify individuals with IGT or a group with a risk of diabetes or IHD similar to those with IGT whose FPG levels are Ͻ6.1 mmol/l.,Tai_2004.txt,1
This may prove a more efficient strategy for identifying those at risk of diabetes or IHD than lowering the diagnostic criteria for IFG to encompass a much larger number of individuals at lower risk.,Tai_2004.txt,0
We are not sug-gesting that the OGTT is required to identify those at risk of diabetes or CVD.,Tai_2004.txt,0
Other means of assessing risk may be available.,Tai_2004.txt,0
For example models incorporating variables such as sex obesity age ethnic group FPG lipids blood pressure and family history have been shown to outperform the 2-h PG in the identification of those at risk of diabetes (26) and CVD (27).,Tai_2004.txt,0
Alternatively we could consider other measures of glycemia (such as HbA 1c ) or markers of systemic inflammation.,Tai_2004.txt,0
The mean age of the cohort was 72 (range 65-92) 62% were female and 14% were black.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
High blood pressure was the most common component within each sex-by-race subgroup ranging from 68% to 86% (Table 1).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Large waist circumference was much more prevalent in women (51-70%) than men (22-27%) of both races.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Applying the new lower limit of fasting glucose ( !5.6 mmol/L) nearly tripled the prevalence of IFG (from 16% to 46%) and led to an additional 9% of the total population being classified as having MetS (Table 1).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Overall the prevalence of MetS using the current (revised) ATP definition in subjects without diabetes mellitus or prior history of CVD was 39% in women and 31% in men (Table 1) with substantial differences by sex and race subgroups (low of 21% in black men to high of 40% in black women).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
In bivariate analysis men who met the revised criteria for MetS were slightly older and more likely to be white and had higher mean fasting insulin and C-reactive protein values than men without the syndrome (Table 2).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In women the presence of MetS was associated with higher mean LDL-C higher mean fasting insulin and higher C-reactive protein.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Within each sex no significant associations were found between MetS and smoking status (P 5.37 in women P 5.84 in men) or family history of CHD or stroke (results not shown).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
As expected measures that constitute the MetS criteria were more prevalent in subjects classified with MetS than those not so classified.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
During follow-up (median of 11 years) 818 CHD 401 stroke and 554 CHF events occurred.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
No evidence of effect Age-and race-adjusted HRs for the association between the revised MetS criteria and incident CHD and CHF were 1.30 (95% CI 5 1.07-1.57) and 1.40 (95% CI 5 1.12-1.76) respectively in women whereas no association was detected for incident stroke (Table 3).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
For men age-and race-adjusted HRs for CHD CHF and stroke were 1.35 (95% CI 5 1.10-1.66) 1.47 (95% CI 5 1.14-1.90) and 1.51 (95% CI 5 1.08-2.12) respectively.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Using a composite endpoint that included the first incidence of CHD CHF or stroke the HRs associated with MetS were 1.21 (95% CI 5 1.04-1.41) in women and 1.32 (95% CI 5 1.10-1.57) in men.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Further adjustment for established CVD risk factors (LDL-C smoking alcohol use caloric intake family history of CHD and use of lipid-lowering medication) resulted in minimal changes in the magnitude of the associations between MetS and CVD outcomes (data not shown).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Excluding subjects taking lipid-lowering medication at baseline from analyses made no difference in the results.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Furthermore age-and race-adjusted HRs for CVD estimated from the ATP-III criteria for MetS (2001) that used the 6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L range for the elevated fasting glucose component differed less than 7% from HRs estimated using the revised MetS (2005) criteria (results not shown).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
In age-and race-adjusted analyses performed separately for each component of MetS (Table 4) high blood pressure and fasting glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol/L) were significantly associated with an approximate 60% to 80% and 30% to 45% increase in CHD respectively.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Women and men who met the revised criteria for IFG (5.6-6.9 mmol/L) were 8% to 28% more likely to experience a CHD event than those with normal glucose (o5.6 mmol/L) although this association was statistically significant only in men.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
The remaining components were less strongly associated with CHD and achieved statistical significance only for elevated triglycerides (men) and low HDL-C (women).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
When all five of the components of the revised MetS were included in a single Cox model the HR for high blood pressure was attenuated slightly but still exhibited the strongest association with CHD of all of the components (results not shown).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
To examine the association between the number of components and incident CHD sex-specific models were fit with categories representing the presence of one two three and four or more components with zero components as the referent (Table 5).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Women and men with four to five components were 2.2 and 2.4 times as likely to experience a CHD event as subjects with zero components.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Furthermore the presence of any two components was positively associated with CHD (women: HR 5 1.84 95% CI 5 1.19-2.84; men: HR 5 2.14 95% CI 5 1.39-3.28).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
When blood pressure was removed as a component (Table 5) the magnitude of the association between each number of remaining components and CHD was attenuated although subjects with three or four components were still approximately 1.5 times as likely to experience incident CHD.],McNeill_2006.txt,0
"[Several population-based studies 7,9-14 have investigated prospectively the link between ATP-III-defined MetS and fatal CVD or a combined fatal and nonfatal CVD endpoint.",McNeill_2006.txt,0
The majority of these studies were conducted in middleaged populations and thus may not be applicable to elderly individuals.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
With the exception of the Strong Study all other studies reported significantly higher risks of CVD according to the presence of MetS after multivariate adjustment for established risk factors.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In an analysis of the publicly available data from the CHS one study 14 reported that the age-and sex-adjusted HR of fatal and nonfatal CVD associated with the ATP-III MetS was 2.12 (95% CI 5 1.77-2.52) which remained significant after adjustment for established risk factors including the individual MetS components (HR 5 1.38 95% CI 5 1.06-1.79).,McNeill_2006.txt,1
The follow-up time for that analysis was truncated to a median of 4 years because the public-use files do not contain the most current CHD and stroke-ascertainment information.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In contrast the current study examined the association over a much longer follow-up period (median of 11 years).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In addition because the previous study 14 included subjects with diabetes mellitus at baseline but excluded all subjects taking antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering medications the generalizability of their findings to elderly subjects (who are commonly treated for hypertension or hypercholesterolemia) is limited.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
"For example in the present study in the subpopulation of CHS participants initially free of diabetes mellitus and CVD removing those taking antihypertension medications alone would have excluded 37% (n 5 1,333) of the study population a subgroup that under current guidelines from the NHLBI 5 would be classified as meeting the high blood pressure component of MetS.",McNeill_2006.txt,1
The current study extends to older people previous findings of an excess risk of CVD attributable to MetS in middle-aged populations.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In the CHS population free of prevalent diabetes mellitus and CVD at baseline MetS was moderately and significantly associated with incident CHD CHF and in men only incident stroke with adjusted HRs ranging from 1.3 to 1.5. Using a composite endpoint that included first incidence of CHD CHF or stroke women and men with MetS were 20% to 30% more likely to experience a CVD event than subjects without MetS.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Furthermore evidence was found to suggest that age modified the association between MetS and CHD but no such evidence for stroke and CHF outcomes.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Although subjects aged 65 to 74 had a 40% increase in the relative risk of CHD associated with MetS no association was observed in CHS subjects aged 75 and older.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
"This finding is consistent with previous research from the CHS 23 and other studies 24,25 indicating that lipids and obesity may be less predictive of CHD in older people possibly due to an increased presence of competing risk factors.",McNeill_2006.txt,0
The risk estimates for CVD from the current study are similar to those of several U.S. studies that have examined individuals without prevalent CVD or diabetes mellitus.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Investigators using data from the Framingham Offspring Study 10 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study 13 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Study 11 and San Antonio Heart Study 12 reported relative risks of fatal or nonfatal CVD ranging from 1.5 to 2.1.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
"Two of these studies 12,13 reported that sex modified the relationship between MetS and CVD.",McNeill_2006.txt,0
The relative risk of CVD mortality was significantly larger in women than men (HR 5 4.7 vs 1.8 interaction P 5.03) in the general population of the San Antonio Heart Study 12 (i.e. including subjects with and without prevalent CHD or diabetes mellitus) after adjusting for age race and ethnicity.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In the biracial community population of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study free of diabetes mellitus and CVD at baseline the association between MetS and combined fatal and nonfatal CHD was stronger in women than men (HR 5 2.0 and respectively interaction P 5.007) after multivariate adjustment.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
13,McNeill_2006.txt,0
The current analysis did not detect a sex interaction for CHD.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Although lack of statistical power to detect such an interaction cannot be excluded it is also possible that because the absolute incidence rate of CVD in women increases from middle to older age the difference in the observed relative risks of CHD associated with MetS for men and women is attenuated.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Results from this study underscore the importance of recognizing and treating high blood pressure in older people as part of CVD prevention efforts.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
23,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Three fourths of this elderly community-based population eligible for primary prevention of CHD had high blood pressure making it the most common of all the MetS components in African Americans and Caucasians.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
"In addition in this study and at least two others 12,13 that examined the associations between individual MetS components and incident CVD high blood pressure exhibited the strongest association with incident CVD of all five components.",McNeill_2006.txt,0
"""The recent recommendation by the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes 4 to change the lower limit of IFG from 6.1 mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L has engendered considerable debate.",McNeill_2006.txt,1
"6,26 Critics of this modification cite the lack of consistent findings of a higher risk of CVD attributable to glycemic levels once other established risk factors are taken into account and the substantial number of Americans who will be classified as having prediabetes but who will never develop diabetes mellitus.",McNeill_2006.txt,0
An analysis of the 1999/2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data 6 indicates that in Americans aged 65 and older the effect of applying the lower glucose threshold will increase the prevalence from 18% to 44%.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
6,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In the current analysis lowering the cutpoint of fasting glucose from 6.1 mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L nearly tripled the prevalence of subjects classified as having IFG from 16% to 46% and resulted in an additional 9% of the population meeting the criteria for MetS.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
In models that estimated the relative risk of each component of MetS using the lower glucose cutpoint resulted in relative risks of CHD associated with IFG that were 12% to 18% lower than those estimated when the original threshold of 6.1 mmol/L was applied.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
However when the lower threshold for IFG was included as part of the MetS criteria the strength of the association between the revised MetS and CHD did not materially differ from the original criteria.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
"Further research is needed to determine whether the lower IFG threshold in isolation or as a component of MetS is useful for identifying elderly patients at high cardiovascular risk that traditional mechanisms do not identify.""",McNeill_2006.txt,1
Several limitations of the data should be recognized.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
First dichotomous representations of truly continuous measures such as those constituting the MetS criteria decrease available information and can result in misclassification of exposure.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
This is especially true for measures with known biological variability and thus may account for the weak association detected between low HDL-C and incident CHD observed in this study.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
In a previous analysis of the CHS 27 a 1-standard deviation difference in HDL-C was strongly and consistently associated with MI even after multivariate adjustment that included other lipid factors.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
It may be that a cutpoint of 1.30 mmol/L in men and 1.03 mmol/L in women does not optimally define the risk associated with low HDL-C and CVD in this population.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
However the purpose of the study was to investigate the associations between CVD and MetS and its individual components as defined using ATP-III in which specific threshold values have been recommended.,McNeill_2006.txt,1
Second the associations observed in this study may be due to survival bias (i.e. that data on individuals most at risk for CHD outcomes associated with the presence of the MetS were not included because such individuals died before reaching the eligibility age for the study).,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Although it can be surmised that the absence of such individuals would only dilute the true association between MetS and incident CVD (bias towards the null) this cannot be confirmed using the CHS data.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
Third the CHS is limited to communityliving adults.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
It excludes those in nursing homes or those too frail to attend clinic visits at baseline.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
These criteria may have excluded many with MetS at high risk for CVD and thus may have also diminished the strengths of association.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
"""Lastly the present analysis excluded CHS subjects with diabetes mellitus at baseline.",McNeill_2006.txt,0
Given that the preliminary analysis found that 79% of these subjects met the criteria for MetS the prevalence figures that are presented are undoubtedly an underestimation of the prevalence of MetS in the combined CHS population of subjects with and without diabetes mellitus.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
However the primary aim of the current study was to estimate the association between MetS and incident CVD outcomes.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
"Because current clinical guidelines from the NHLBI 3 for the prevention of CHD and treatment of high LDL-C consider prevalent diabetes mellitus to be a CHD-risk equivalent diabetes would likely drive any association between the MetS and CHD subjects with baseline diabetes mellitus were not included.""",McNeill_2006.txt,0
In conclusion results from this study of an elderly population-based cohort provide support for earlier investigations in primarily middle-aged populations that link the presence of MetS with the development of CVD and further underscore the importance of recognizing and treating its individual components particularly high blood pressure.,McNeill_2006.txt,0
"We report findings from a subset of 1,336 Europeans and 1,139 South Asians without prevalent CHD or stroke at baseline either with a full set of baseline HbA 1c plus fasting and postload glucose measurements or with known diabetes and who had follow-up data for CHD and stroke (Fig. 1).",Eastwood_2015.txt,0
African Caribbeans were excluded due to small numbers.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
There were no consistent differences between participants for whom we did and did not have the full set of blood samples.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Overt diabetes was more prevalent and cardiometabolic risk factors were generally more adverse in South Asians than Europeans (Table 1).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
South Asians had a higher prevalence of HbA 1cdefined prediabetes than Europeans though prevalence was similar when IFG/IGT criteria were used.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
For both ethnic groups the prevalence of prediabetes was over twofold higher when defined by ADA HbA 1c thresholds as opposed to IEC HbA 1c thresholds or IFG/IGT.,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of CHD in Europeans but not South Asians (Table 2).,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Associations were strongest for IEC HbA 1c -defined prediabetes.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
This association persisted after adjustment for CVD risk factors and for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors (Table 3).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Conversely in South Asians no measure of prediabetes was associated with CHD risk.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
This ethnic difference in association between prediabetes and CHD was significant as an interaction (P = 0.008 in the cardiovascular risk factor-adjusted model).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Of note diabetes was similarly related to CHD in each ethnic group regardless of diagnostic criteria.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
In contrast no prediabetes measure was associated with stroke risk in Europeans whereas for South Asians all three measures were associated in age-and sex-adjusted models (Table 3).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
After adjustment for CVD risk factors only the IEC HbA 1c -defined prediabetes association retained significance though associations for the other prediabetes measures remained of large magnitude.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
There was some evidence that this measure was more associated with stroke risk in South Asians than Europeans (ethnicity interaction P = 0.11 in the cardiovascular risk factor-adjusted model).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Corresponding with ethnic differences in prediabetes associations overt diabetes also appeared to be more strongly associated with stroke risk in South Asians than Europeans though again this was not significant as an interaction (P = 0.18).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Findings for CVD reflected those for CHD with strong associations for prediabetes observed in Europeans but not South Asians particularly for the IEC HbA 1c criterion (P = 0.04 for ethnicity by prediabetes interaction).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
An important potential explanation for the ethnic differences observed in the association between prediabetes and CVD outcomes is control of key CVD risk factors.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"At follow-up a lower percentage of Europeans than South Asians with baseline prediabetes on lipid-lowering medication had a total cholesterol ,5.0 mmol/L (55% vs. 92% P = 0.004 for IEC-defined prediabetes) or an LDL cholesterol of ,3.0 mmol/L (66% vs. 91% P = 0.03).",Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Rates of lipid-lowering medication use were generally higher in South Asians than Europeans with baseline prediabetes (75% vs. 58% 68% vs. 73% and 69% vs. 57% for IFG/IGT IEC-defined prediabetes and ADA-defined prediabetes respectively) (Table 2 and Supplementary Data).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Adjusting for baseline lipids alone did not explain ethnic differences and there were no interactions between prediabetes and lipid measures on these outcomes.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Baseline diastolic but not systolic pressure was higher in South Asians than Europeans.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"But in addition blood pressure control (defined as ,140/90 mmHg for those on antihypertensives) was generally worse in South Asians than Europeans with prediabetes both at baseline and at follow-up (Tables 1  and 2 and Supplementary Data).",Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Further both mean diastolic and mean systolic pressures were higher in South Asians than Europeans in those on treatment.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
No other baseline CVD risk factor appeared to be consistently worse in the prediabetic state in one ethnicity than the other (Table 1 and Supplementary Data).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Ethnic differences in associations between prediabetes and stroke remained when adjusted for baseline blood pressure and use of antihypertensive medication and again there were no statistically significant prediabetes 3 blood pressure (systolic or diastolic) interactions in either ethnic group.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
For participants with prediabetes at baseline rates of conversion to overt diabetes were higher in South Asians than Europeans: 68% vs. 40% P  0.001 for IFG/IGT; 52% vs. 30% P = 0.006 for IECdefined prediabetes; and 44% vs. 23% P  0.001 for ADA-defined prediabetes.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0

-In whole sample the prevalence of the various components of the metabolic syndrome were as follows: impaired glucose regulation (IFG or IGT) or type 2 diabetes 22.6% (n ϭ 201) central obesity 73.6% (n ϭ 654) dyslipidemia 30.8% (n ϭ 274) hypertension 62.0% (n ϭ 551) and microalbuminuria 12.0% (n ϭ 107).,Bonora_2003.txt,1
A total of 72 (8.1%) subjects had none of the clinical traits of the metabolic syndrome as defined by WHO and 208 (23.4%) had only one trait.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
In addition 264 (29.7%) 178 (20.0%) 102 (11.5%) 52 (5.8%) and 12 (1.3%) had two three four five or six traits simultaneously present respectively and 303 (34.1%) subjects fulfilled the WHO diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The main baseline clinical and biochemical data of these subjects are summarized in Table 1.,Bonora_2003.txt,0

At baseline the prevalence of plaques of any size was 42.3% whereas the prevalence of carotid stenosis Ͼ40% was 5.2%.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The baseline prevalence of definite or probable CHD was 10.3% and that of possible CHD was 10.0%.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Subjects with the metabolic syndrome according to WHO criteria showed a significantly increased risk of development or progression of carotid atherosclerosis during the 5-year followup.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
In fact changes in the atherosclerosis score (sum of all plaques if any) in 1995 compared with baseline as well as the percent of subjects who developed new plaques (early atherogenesis) or arterial stenosis Ͼ40% (advanced atherogenesis) from 1990 to 1995 were higher in subjects with the metabolic syndrome than in control subjects.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
All of these differences were significant after adjusting for sex age smoking alcohol physical activity social status LDL cholesterol and baseline atherosclerosis (Table 2).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The multiple-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident plaques and for incident stenosis in subjects with the metabolic syndrome compared with control subjects were 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.1 P ϭ 0.02) and 2.4 (1.3-4.1 P ϭ 0.01) respectively (Table 3 model 2).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Subjects with the metabolic syndrome according to WHO criteria also showed an increased incidence of definite (fatal and nonfatal) CHD during the 5-year follow-up compared with that of control subjects.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
This difference was significant after adjusting for sex age smoking alcohol physical activity social status LDL cholesterol and baseline CHD (Table 2).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The exclusion of subjects with preexisting CHD (definite probable or possible) did not change the results (incident CHD 5 vs. 2% P ϭ 0.046 in subjects with the metabolic syndrome and control subjects respectively).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The multiple-adjusted OR for incident CHD in subjects with the metabolic syndrome was 2.3 (CI 1.2-4.3 P ϭ 0.01) (Table 3 model 2).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
When we evaluated with separate multiple logistic regression models the specific risks for carotid atherosclerosis or CHD associated with the various traits composing the metabolic syndrome (i.e. hypertension dyslipidemia central obesity impaired glucose regulation microalbuminuria and insulin resistance as categorical variables) we found that: 1) none of the above-mentioned traits was a significant independent predictor of incident carotid plaques; 2) impaired glucose regulation/diabetes and dyslipidemia were the only significant independent predictors of incident carotid stenosis; and 3) hypertension was the only signifi-cant independent predictor of incident CHD (Table 3 model 1).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Most importantly when we excluded from the analysis subjects with diabetes and/or definite hypertension (treatment and/or systolic blood pressure Ͼ160 and/or diastolic blood pressure Ͼ95 mmHg) and focused on subjects with mild abnormalities (IFG/IGT mild hypertension along with dyslipidemia central obesity microalbuminuria and insulin resistance) we found that none of the individual components of the metabolic syndrome was an independent predictor of carotid atherosclerosis or CHD (Table 3 model 3).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
In this analysis restricted to subjects without diabetes or definite hypertension a separate model confirmed that the metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and CHD (Table 3 model 4).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
When we used a more stringent criterion to define insulin resistance setting the threshold at the lower limit of the top quintile of HOMA-estimated insulin resistance in lean subjects with no metabolic disorder as we did in a previous study (25) thus including in the category of the metabolic syndrome ϳ50% of the sample the results were not substantially different.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
In further analyses we examined the risk associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome as identified by NCEP-ATPIII criteria.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
Among subjects diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome using these criteria (n ϭ 158) 47% had incident new plaques 42% had incident stenosis and 6% had incident CHD.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
The corresponding figures for the rest of the sample (n ϭ 730) were 39% ( 2 P ϭ 0.216) 20% ( 2 P ϭ 0.0006) and 5% ( 2 P ϭ 0.32) respectively.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The multipleadjusted risk of incident new plaques (OR 1.30 P ϭ NS) and incident carotid stenosis (3.1 P Ͻ 0.001) as well as the multiple-adjusted risk of incident CHD (1.5 P ϭ NS) computed by logistic regression analysis were not superimposable but were similar to those we yielded when using the WHO criteria.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
We also examined the risk of atherosclerosis and CHD in subjects positive according to both WHO and NCEP-ATPIII criteria (n ϭ 117) to WHO criteria only (n ϭ 186) and to NCEP criteria only (n ϭ 41).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Compared with control subjects we found that subjects positive according to WHO criteria and not NCEP criteria had a significantly higher risk of incident carotid stenosis (OR 2.17 P ϭ 0.02) and incident CHD (2.64 P ϭ 0.009).,Bonora_2003.txt,1
In subjects who were positive according to NCEP criteria and negative according to WHO criteria the ORs were similar (incident carotid stenosis 2.39 and incident CHD 2.35) but the CIs were large and the P values were not significant due to low statistical power.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
In subjects positive according to both WHO and NCEP crite-ria the risk was not substantially higher than in subjects positive by only WHO or NCEP criteria (incident plaques OR 1.72 P ϭ 0.03; incident carotid stenosis 5.06 P Ͻ 0.001; incident CHD 2.08 P ϭ 0.11).,Bonora_2003.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS,Bonora_2003.txt,0
-To the best of our knowledge the present study provides the first population-based prospective information on both carotid atherosclerosis and CHD in subjects with the metabolic syndrome as diagnosed according to the most recent criteria indicated by the WHO (7) or the NCEP-ATPIII (8).,Bonora_2003.txt,1
We focused on subjects from the general population aged Ն40 years as they represent the segment of the popu-lation with the highest risk of the syndrome.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The unique findings of our study are that subjects with the metabolic syndrome identified with clinically applicable criteria had significantly greater incidence/progression of carotid atherosclerosis and greater risk for incident CHD than those without the syndrome.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
Moreover most components of the syndrome were not significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis or CHD when considered individually whereas the syndrome was a significant predictor of the outcomes we examined.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
"These findings which need to be confirmed in larger databases with greater statistical power and applied particularly to subjects with a cluster of mild abnormalities (e.g. IFG or IGT rather than diabetes) and/or minor risk factors (e.g. central obesity or microalbuminuria) are pivotal in addressing one of the critical questions about the metabolic syndrome: ""What is the value of identifying this phenotype beyond the recognition and treatment of its component traits?""",Bonora_2003.txt,0
Answering such questions is one of the key advances in the understanding of this syndrome.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Our data support the conclusion that a focus on the coexistence of multiple mild abnormalities allows one to identify a large number of subjects at risk of atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular disease who would be missed with a focus limited to single abnormalities (e.g. definite hypertension diabetes and severe dyslipidemia).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
As a consequence it seems that there is a clear improvement in vascular risk prediction when using the metabolic syndrome approach.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
The results of a study by Isooma et al. (26) which focused on myocardial infarction stroke and cardiovascular mortality in a sample of Finnish people are consistent with ours in reporting an increased cardiovascular risk in subjects with the metabolic syndrome.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
However this study was not population-based and focused on highly selected high-risk relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects and did not report data on atherosclerosis which underlies clinical events.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
A different set of diagnostic criteria for identifying subjects with the metabolic syndrome were recently proposed by the NCEP-ATPIII (8).,Bonora_2003.txt,1
When we used these criteria subjects with the syndrome were approximately one-half of those identified with the WHO criteria.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
Al- though ORs were not superimposable and P values were not always significant due to lower statistical power subjects with the metabolic syndrome by NCEP-ATPIII criteria were also at higher risk of carotid atherosclerosis and CHD.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Interestingly both subjects for the metabolic syndrome only by WHO criteria and those positive only by NCEP-ATPIII criteria were at greater risk.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Thus none of these two criteria seems superior to the other in the definition of the cardiovascular risk.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
However a greater number of subjects at risk are identified by WHO criteria.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
In this respect the latter might be preferred.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
On the other hand it is unquestionable that NCEP-ATPIII criteria are easier to apply because they do not require insulin and microalbuminuria assessment or an OGTT.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
Our finding of an increased incidence/progression of carotid atherosclerosis and CHD in subjects with the metabolic syndrome is consistent with data obtained with factor analysis of clinical and biochemical characters clustering with hyperinsulinemia in three epidemiological studies carried out in Finland (27)(28)(29).,Bonora_2003.txt,0
These analyses suggested that a putative insulin resistance factor predicts cardiovascular disease in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
However this factor was composed by different sets of variables in the three studies.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
Most importantly the results of factor analyses can be applied only to the database from which they were extracted and cannot be transferred to other databases or to the clinical arena.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
In this respect it is important to emphasize that in our study clinically applicable criteria to define the metabolic syndrome were able to identify subjects with a proven increase in atherosclerosis and CHD incidence.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
In conclusion the metabolic syndrome which occurs very frequently in the general population is burdened by a more frequent incidence and progression of carotid atherosclerosis and a higher incidence of CHD.,Bonora_2003.txt,1
The identification of subjects with the metabolic syndrome is conceivably useful from a clinical standpoint as it can be anticipated that these individuals should benefit from interventions aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk.,Bonora_2003.txt,0
As a corollary our findings strongly suggest that current risk reduction recommendations focusing on single risk factor identification and correction should be replaced by targeting individuals with the cluster and tailoring treatment possibly on the underlying mechanisms like insulin resistance responsible for or contributing to the complex of coexisting abnormalities.,Bonora_2003.txt,0

Sudden cardiac arrest in adults is mainly due to underlying CHD and the most common electrophysiological mechanism of SCD is ventricular arrhythmias.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
Previous findings suggest that myocardial as well as electrical abnormalities are likely to influence the risk of SCD (24).,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0

"Cardiac autonomic dysfunction is a complication of the asymptomatic prediabetes state and type 2 diabetes (25,26) and impaired FPG can be considered as a prestage of type 2 diabetes which suggests the early presence of autonomic nervous dysfunction (25).",Laukkanen_2013.txt,1
Increased insulin resistance with elevated glucose levels is associated with a higher resting heart rate and lower heart rate variability representing the decline of cardiovascular autonomic function (27).,Laukkanen_2013.txt,1
Other mechanisms by which impaired FPG and type 2 diabetes may affect SCD risk include intraventricular conduction abnormalities due to autonomic imbalance and disturbed myocardial function (25)(26)(27)(28).,Laukkanen_2013.txt,1

"Some studies have found that the hyperglycemic and prothrombotic state could be a factor related to a higher risk of SCD (3,4,29).",Laukkanen_2013.txt,1

However due to the observational nature of this study it does not allow any estimation of the impact of FPG-lowering therapies on the incidence of SCD.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
The results suggest that the level of impaired FPG itself may be an important risk factor for out-of-hospital SCD; although the importance of very strict FPG control in the prevention of ventricular arrhythmias would require confirmation from clinical trials.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
The focus of this study was to show the association of impaired FPG with SCD risk.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
We explored SCD by incorporating serum measures of hemostatic factors serum lipids blood pressure and inflammatory measures in the multivariable model.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
The strength of our study includes the availability of autopsy data in 80% of the SCD cases during the long-term follow-up.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
"In our study the incidence of SCD was somewhat higher than in some of the other lower-risk populations (11,30).",Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
The current study has been performed in an area known for its high prevalence of coronary artery disease (as an underlying cause for SCD) in previous  decades (31).,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
FPG yielded a modest improvement in SCD prediction when other risk factors were taken into account.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
There was an improvement in the level of ination while using FPG in addition to other risk factors.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
A discrimination analysis showed a significant level of discrimination between men with and without a known FPG.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
Our study shows that impaired FPG which is an easily available everyday clinical method can be used as a predictive marker for the risk of SCD.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
A limitation of this study was that the formal competing risk analyses were not performed.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
The observed associations between FPG and type 2 diabetes with the risk of main outcomes including nonfatal CHD events were statistically significant.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
The main findings would not have markedly changed even if the formal competing risk analysis was taken into account.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
Consistently it has been previously shown that impaired fasting glucose is related to an increased risk of major cardiovascular events (32).,Laukkanen_2013.txt,1
The follow-up studies may have been biased by the participants receiving advice on how to change their lifestyle when appropriate as well as the reporting of the study findings to their physicians.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
The single assessment of FPG at baseline may lead to an underestimation rather than an overestimation of the prognostic significance of FPG.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
In clinical practice however the assessment of FPG should be repeated to check the effect of dietary and physical activity habits or other therapies.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
Our representative sample of men makes it possible to generalize the observed results to male populations but it is important to confirm the results on impaired FPG and the risk of SCD in female populations.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
Our results suggest that not only men with type 2 diabetes but also nondiabetic men with impaired FPG have an increased risk of out-of-hospital SCD.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0
Impaired FPG levels can provide valuable information as prevention appears to be a viable approach for substantially decreasing the devastating effects of sudden cardiac arrest in the population.,Laukkanen_2013.txt,0

Therefore in our study it is unlikely that the sex interaction we observed is due to hyperglycemia alone.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Although we found a positive association between increasing number of ATP III metabolic syndrome components and CHD risk results from our analysis indicate that the individual components for elevated blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol have the strongest effects on CHD risk.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Using data from the ARIC study Golden et al. ( 25) assessed the association between groupings of variables related to the metabolic syndrome and intimal-medial wall thickness of the carotid arteries as a measure of generalized atherosclerosis.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
They found that several combinations of risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome conferred excess additive risk beyond the level predicted by the individual components.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Conversely in our analysis multivariate proportional hazards modeling of all five components plus an indicator for the metabolic syndrome did not detect excess CHD associated with the presence of the These are consistent with a cross-sectional analysis by Alexander et al. (26) who reported that although elevated blood pressure low HDL cholesterol and diabetes were significantly associated with prevalent CHD they found no indication of excess risk for the ATP III-defined metabolic syndrome once the individual components had been accounted for in multiplicative risk models.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Although the ATP III report recommends screening for the metabolic syndrome specific recommendations for therapeutic lifestyle change and/or phar-  Metabolic syndrome and CVD in the ARIC study macologic therapy are based on the number of CHD risk factors present at the time of screening and category of 10-year risk of CHD estimated by the FRS algorithm (Ͻ10% 10 -20% and Ͼ20%).,McNeill_2005.txt,1
In the present analysis inclusion of the metabolic syndrome did not add to CHD prediction models that included the FRS.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
However as outlined in the ATP III report (13) the FRS was developed to identify individuals primarily for short-term risk reduction (Յ10 years) whereas identification of individuals with metabolic syndrome is aimed at long-term risk reduction primarily through lifestyle modification.,McNeill_2005.txt,1
Nevertheless patients falling in the category of Ͻ20% CHD risk who met the criteria for the metabolic syndrome had a higher absolute rate of CHD than those without the syndrome.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
These findings are similar to those reported by Girman et al. (27) who categorized individuals from two large lipid-lowering clinical trials by FRSs of either Ͼ20 or Յ20% and found that individuals with the ATP III metabolic syndrome had a higher risk of major coronary events than comparison subjects within FRS categories.,McNeill_2005.txt,1
In a joint analysis of the Framingham Offspring and San Antonio Heart Studies (28) those with the metabolic syndrome had a greater average FRS than those without regardless of ethnicity.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Taken together these findings indicate that individuals within the same FRS category who have the metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of CHD relative to subjects without the syndrome.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
This suggests that identification of metabolic syndrome may have prognostic value to medical practitioners for patients in both the upper (Ͼ20%) and lower (Յ20%) FRS categories.,McNeill_2005.txt,1
The present investigation has several strengths.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
The ARIC study is one of the largest and longest followed biracial samples of U.S. adults with validated CHD and stroke outcomes and standardized collection of covariate information.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
However several limitations of the data should be kept in mind.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
The ARIC cohort was selected from four U.S. communities but is not representative of the U.S. in general.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Because the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome can vary widely by demographic characteristics of study participants (29) caution should be used in extrapolating these results to other populations.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Participants excluded due to missing information (7.7%) were more likely to be black and hypertensive but otherwise were similar to the analysis population.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Sensitivity analyses performed by varying the proportion of these individuals classified as having CHD or metabolic syndrome at baseline and refitting Cox models resulted in negligible changes from reported HRs.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Finally in Cox models that included all five components of the metabolic syndrome elevated blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol but not elevated triglycerides had statistically significant associations with CHD.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Although it is not uncommon to include both HDL cholesterol and triglycerides as independent variables in CHD prediction models such inclusion can result in biased estimates of effects because of the generally strong correlation between the two lipid measures and the relatively greater intraindividual variability of fasting triglycerides (30).,McNeill_2005.txt,0
Under such conditions HDL cholesterol may be more likely to show an independent association with CHD as a function of its measurement qualities rather than through any more direct causal link with CHD.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
A previously published assessment (31) of the reliability of fasting-state lipoprotein measurements in ARIC indicated that the reliability coefficient was higher for HDL cholesterol than triglycerides (0.94 0.85,McNeill_2005.txt,0
As such we cannot rule out this phenomenon in our results.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
According to the American Diabetes Association (32) CVD is the cause of death in as many as 75-80% of individuals with diabetes.,McNeill_2005.txt,1
"The ""common soil"" (33) hypothesis posits that diabetes is not a direct cause of CVD but rather one of several atherosclerotic sequelae arising from shared precursors.",McNeill_2005.txt,1
The metabolic syndrome may be a clinically recognizable and in many cases an early manifestation of such shared antecedents that increase the risk of diabetes and CVD among individuals.,McNeill_2005.txt,1
Identifying individuals with the metabolic syndrome and investigating effective treatment options may provide opportunities for intervention early in the disease pathways of both diseases.,McNeill_2005.txt,0
However additional research is needed to refine the metabolic syndrome definition and to determine whether treatment of underlying conditions such as insulin resistance results in improved CHD prevention for patients with the metabolic syndrome beyond the level achieved by interventions currently targeted at its specific components.,McNeill_2005.txt,0

Mortality by HbA 1c level,Skriver_2010.txt,0
The impact of HbA 1c was analysed only in individuals with NGT but with inclusion of two comparison groups namely those at low risk of diabetes and those found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
After stratification individuals with an HbA 1c of 6.5% or above had lower survival and thereby higher all-cause mortality than all other groups (Fig. 1).,Skriver_2010.txt,1
HRs for individuals at low risk of diabetes and individuals with HbA 1c at 6.0% or below as respective reference groups are given in Table 2. Composed with individuals at low risk of diabetes and adjusting for age and sex the highest HR was found for individuals with NGT and HbA 1c at 6.5% or above (HR 2.87 95% CI 1.40-5.86).,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Likewise composed with individuals found to have NGT and HbA 1c <6.0% while adjusting for other potential confounders (i.e. besides age and sex: BMI smoking systolic BP previous IHD previous cerebrovascular disease and previous cancer) the highest HR was found for individuals with NGT and HbA 1c at 6.5% or above (HR 2.48 95% CI 1.23-4.99).,Skriver_2010.txt,0
For both reference groups and for the respective adjustments we found a dose-response relationship between level of HbA 1c and mortality although it was not statistically significant.,Skriver_2010.txt,0

A 10% increased risk of mortality from all-cause mortality was associated with a 1-SD increase in fasting glucose (1.18 mmol/l) and a 14% increased risk with a 1-SD increase in 2-h glucose (3.18 mmol/l) after adjusting for age sex race smoking status physical activity BMI systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (Table 3) but the lower limit of the 95% CI was the null value.,Saydah_2001.txt,0

For example with regard to all-cause mortality and after adjusting for all of the above-mentioned covariates compared with participants with normal glucose tolerance participants with diagnosed diabetes at baseline had the greatest HR ratio by both WHO and ADA criteria (Table 4).,Saydah_2001.txt,1
Participants with undiagnosed or diagnosed diabetes had an increased but nonsignificant risk of mortality by both WHO and ADA criteria (Table 4).,Saydah_2001.txt,0
Based on the WHO definition participants with IGT had a 14% increased risk of mortality and based on the ADA definition participants with impaired fasting glucose had an 8% increased risk of mortality compared with those with normal glucose (Table 4).,Saydah_2001.txt,1

In fact the group with normal fasting and 2-h glucose Ն11.1 mmol/l had the highest mortality of all groups in this elderly population (n ϭ 182).,Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
Table 2 shows the risk factoradjusted relative risk (RR) for total and cardiovascular mortality by diabetes status after excluding individuals taking medications for diabetes or with an incomplete OGTT.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
We found that diabetes based on the ADA or the WHO classifications similarly predicted total and cardiovascular disease mortality after risk factor adjustment.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
In addition (data not shown in Table 2) subjects taking medications for diabetes also showed an increased risk for total and cardiovascular disease mortality compared with subjects with normal values according to the ADA and the WHO criteria as the reference group respectively (RR for total mortality was 2.2 by ADA and 2.5 by WHO criteria and the RR for cardiovascular disease mortality was 2.6 by ADA and 3.4 by WHO criteria for the reference group).,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
The increased risk among subjects with diabetes taking medications compared with untreated or unrecognized diabetes is presumably due to the longer duration of the disease.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Table 3 shows that when fasting and 2-h glucose measurements are included in the models simultaneously as continuous variables and after adjusting for other risk factors such as age BMI waist-to-hip ratio physical activity hypertension triglycerides HDL cholesterol and fibrinogen the 2-h glucose measurement was a superior predictor and was independent of fasting glucose both for total as well as for cardiovascular disease mortality in this elderly group.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
The present data indicate that fasting glucose contributed nothing to relative risk if the 2-h measurement was used.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
-The present investigation suggests that the prevalence of glucose metabolism abnormalities is very high among elderly Japanese-American men.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Overall 18% of this population re-ported diabetes by history or use of medication.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
There are large differences in the prevalence of diabetes impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose and normal status depending on which classification is used.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
The ADA classification using fasting glucose only results in 66% fewer subjects with unrecognized or untreated diabetes and more than twice the number of normal subjects (33 vs. 69%) in this sample of elderly men.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
It seems that these discrepancies are common especially in studies that include elderly individuals (17); however the difference observed in this study is larger than in any other population described in the literature.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
The Honolulu Heart Program data show that subjects taking medications for diabetes as well as those with unrecognized and untreated diabetes are at significantly increased risk of total and cardiovascular disease mortality compared with normal subjects.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
No significant associations were observed for impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose in this elderly group.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Similar relative risks were observed regardless of which classification was used (WHO versus ADA).,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
However the absolute numbers of persons who would be identified as being at high risk are vastly different.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
The ADA criteria which uses fasting glucose only fails to identify a large number of subjects (66% of subjects with diabetes) who are at high risk.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
We also observed a disproportionately high mortality rate among subjects with fasting glucose Ͻ7.0 and 2-h glucose Ն11.1 mmol/l; ϳ9% of the subjects fall into this category.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
The results shown here are somewhat different from previous Honolulu Heart Program reports which were based on data collected in 1965 with 23 years of follow-up.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
"Analyses based on those data found glucose intolerance to be a significant predictor of coronary heart disease stroke and total mortality in addition to known and unrecognized diabetes (3,8,9).",Rodriguez_2002.txt,1
However the data presented here are not directly comparable because the glucose level obtained in 1965 was based on a 50-g nonfasting 1-h postload glucose measurement which was the standard measurement obtained in epidemiologic studies at that time.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Also previous analyses were based on substantially longer follow-up and a much younger age group.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
This is the first report from the Honolulu Heart Program to examine results from a 75-g OGTT applying the WHO and ADA criteria in relation to subsequent outcomes in an elderly cohort.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
In this investigation we also analyzed the data treating the fasting and 2-h glucose measurements as continuous variables.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
We found that the 2-h measurement supported by the WHO but not by the ADA is a superior predictor of total and cardiovascular disease mortality compared with fasting glucose alone.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
The 2-h measurement has an effect on total and cardiovascular disease mortality that is independent of the fasting glucose value in this elderly population whereas fasting glucose is not independent of the 2-h value.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Fasting glucose levels contribute nothing to relative risk if the 2-h glucose is used.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
The difference in the results based on categorical versus continuous analyses observed suggests that the application of the current cutoff points in the ADA and WHO guidelines must be reevaluated.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
To our knowledge this is the first study to examine fasting and 2-h glucose measurements as continuous variables in an elderly cohort in order to assess their relative role as predictors of total and cardiovascular mortality.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Our findings suggest that future research must be conducted to define more appropriate cutoff points for diabetes impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance categories for different ethnic groups ages and sexes.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Currently however it is important to retain the 2-h glucose measurements especially in epidemiologic studies until these discrepancies can be sorted out.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0
Undoubtedly these discrepancies are explained by the fact that hyperglycemia is due to a combination of insulin resistance hepatic glucose overproduction and impaired ␤-cell function and the relationship and combination of each of these factors with complications associated with diabetes.,Rodriguez_2002.txt,0

Among the subjects 18.2% were defined as having MetS 21.1% had IFG and 6.8% had diabetes (Figure 1).,Liu_2007.txt,1
The prevalence of MetS in IFG and diabetes was 38.1% and 48.7% 4.0 and 5.1 times of that in subjects with normal fasting glucose (NFG) respectively.,Liu_2007.txt,1
Sixty-two percent of the subjects with MetS had IFG or diabetes which was 3.1 times of that prevalent in non-MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,0
After adjustment for age and sex the risk factor levels were higher in subjects with the MetS regardless of glucose levels except for smoking (Table I).,Liu_2007.txt,0
Another potentially important finding was a strikingly higher prevalence of elevated non-HDL-C in persons with MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,0
As shown in Table II IFG or diabetes were associated with higher incidence risk of CHD ischemic stroke and total CVD but not hemorrhagic stroke compared with NFG.,Liu_2007.txt,1
Subjects with MetS had higher risk of CHD ischemic stroke hemorrhagic stroke and total CVD than those without MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The impact of MetS on CVD was further assessed according to the number of components and different combinations of the components.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The latter was undertaken for total CVD only because the number of cases was limited for separate analysis of CHD and stroke.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Cardiovascular disease risk increased in proportion to the number MetS components (Table II) and there was a wide variation depending on profile of concomitant disorders.,Liu_2007.txt,0
If only 1 component was present elevated BP was the only significant predictor of CVD.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The impact of hyperglycemia was slight and nonsignificant if no other components were coexisted.,Liu_2007.txt,0
When 2 components were present 6 of the 10 combinations were associated with significantly higher risk.,Liu_2007.txt,0
However all combinations of z3 components (MetS) had significant contribution except for those rare phenotypes (b1% of the whole sample) (Table III).,Liu_2007.txt,0
To compare MetS with prediabetes and diabetes the CVD risk was presented in Figure 2 according to presence or absence of MetS and glycemic status after adjusting nonmetabolic risk factors.,Liu_2007.txt,0
In the absence of MetS IFG and diabetes carried a mild and lower risk of developing CHD than MetS without IFG or diabetes and the risk associated with IFG was higher than that for diabetes.,Liu_2007.txt,1
When all forms of dysglycemia combined hyperglycemia without MetS was associated with a mild and nonsignificant increased risk for CHD (HR 1.38 95% CI 0.98-1.95) whereas MetS carried a significant risk of CHD even in the absence of hyperglycemia (HR 1.86 95% CI 1.21-2.86) compared with subjects without either MetS or hyperglycemia.,Liu_2007.txt,1
Subjects with MetS had a higher incidence risk of ischemic stroke regardless of the level of dysglycemia Waist waist circumference z90 cm in men and z80 cm in women; TG z150 mg/dL; BP systolic BP z130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP z 85 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medication; GLU z100 mg/dL or previously diagnosed diabetes; HDL-C b40 mg/dL in men and b50 mg/dL in women.,Liu_2007.txt,1
(Figure 2).,Liu_2007.txt,0
Nonetheless even in the absence of MetS diabetes was accompanied by a higher incidence of ischemic stroke compared with those with either NFG or IFG.,Liu_2007.txt,1
This was true even if those with isolated hyperglycemia did not have higher prevalence of elevated BP than those without hyperglycemia (Table I).,Liu_2007.txt,0
Once MetS was present the incidence of ischemic stroke rose markedly.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Of interest neither IFG nor diabetes was accompanied by an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Individuals with MetS had a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke than did those without MetS (Table II).,Liu_2007.txt,0

There are some limitations in this study.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Some important risk factors especially for cardiovascular disease and death were not available for all subjects e.g. smoking habits was noticed for around half of the sample and blood lipid values were not measured.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
The number of subjects in some of the groups i.e. with FBG values beneath 3.0 mmol/l and above 6.0 mmol/l including the subjects with known diabetes was too small to allow secure evaluations.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Thus the analyses in further sub-groups e.g. into men and women and regarding CVD-and cancer-mortality should be interpreted with caution as the numbers were too low to yield enough statistical power.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
However the general tendencies could be seen in these sub-groups as well even if no conclusions could be drawn between differences between men and women or between total CVD and cancer-mortality.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Glucose values were measured on one single occasion and no oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
"Otherwise it is recommended that the 2-hour glucose value at a 75-g OGTT be used rather than the FBG value for the diabetes diagnosis as around 30% of the diabetic subjects will not be diagnosed because of normal FBG while having a diabetic 2-h glucose [21,22].",Wandell_2005.txt,0

As a predictor of all-cause mortality being an Indian with diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.86 (95 percent CI: 1.76 8.44) in comparison with being a Chinese with diabetes (table 5).,Ma_2003.txt,1
Of As shown in Table 2 compared with participants with normal glucose regulation participants with prediabetes who had 1 of these ICVHMs exhibited significantly lower risk for CVD: ideal BMI (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72-0.98) physical activity at goal (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.64-0.95) healthy diet (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.71-0.95) ideal total cholesterol (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75-0.99) and ideal blood pressure (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.48-0.71).,Wang_2019.txt,0
Compared with participants with normal glucose regulation among participants with prediabetes the HR for CVD gradu-ally decreased from 1.34 (95% CI 1.16-1.55) in those who had 1 ICVHM or less to 0.57 (95% CI 0.43-0.75) in those who had more than 5 ICVHMs.,Wang_2019.txt,1
Participants with diabetes who had ideal blood pressure had a marginally lower risk for CVD (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.71-1.18) and the risk for CVD decreased with an increasing number of ICVHMs (≤1 ICVHM: HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.76-2.38; ≥5 ICVHMs: HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.56-1.15) as compared with participants with normal glucose regulation.,Wang_2019.txt,1

In contrast the IFG stage 1 group did not show an increased mortality risk compared with the reference group.,Kim_2017.txt,0
The same analyses were conducted for each vascular disease subtype (Table 3).,Kim_2017.txt,0
Among the total vascular disease deaths IHD was the most frequent cause of death (34.5%) followed by IS (23.9%) and HS (22.4%).,Kim_2017.txt,0
The independence between mortality from vascular disease subtypes and fasting glucose levels was rejected with P value of 0.001 showing that mortality from IS was positively related to IFG stage 2 and mortality from HS was negatively related to DM. Subjects with DM had a significantly higher mortality risk because of all vascular disease subtypes.,Kim_2017.txt,0
On the contrary in all adjustment models IFG stage 2 subjects exhibited an increased IS mortality but not IHD or HS mortality.,Kim_2017.txt,0
In particular the subjects with IFG stage 2 had even higher IS mortality risk than those with DM in a full adjustment model including medical treatments (HR 1.75 versus 1.41 in model C).,Kim_2017.txt,0

"6,7,[16][17][18]",Kim_2017.txt,0
However some level of uncertainty exists mainly in defining the fasting glucose cutoff value that is associated with an increased vascular disease risk and the type of vascular disease that demonstrates higher risk in the prediabetics.,Kim_2017.txt,1
Although the newer IFG criteria (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL) defined by the American Diabetes Association in 2003 was based on the risk of developing DM in the future 2 most large-scale studies including the DECODE (Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis of Diagnostic criteria in Europe); Hoorn; and the Framingham heart study generally indicated that the cutoff fasting glucose value associated with increased cardiovascular risk is 110 mg/dL (the 1997 American Diabetes Association criteria for IFG).,Kim_2017.txt,1
"7,12,18",Kim_2017.txt,0
The results of our study are concordant with these findings.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Furthermore given that vascular disease reflects pathophysiologically and clinically heterogeneous vascular events conflicting results have been reported for the association between prediabetes and the risk of various vascular disease subtypes.,Kim_2017.txt,0
For instance the Asia Pacific Cohort study reported that fasting plasma glucose in the prediabetic range was an important risk determinant of both IHD and stroke.,Kim_2017.txt,1
5 Similarly the Korean Heart study observed that a higher degree of IFG was associated with an increased risk of incident IHD and IS but not HS.,Kim_2017.txt,0
9,Kim_2017.txt,0
"In contrast the Funagata study and the KNHS study (Korean National Health Insurance System) demonstrated that prediabetes increased the risk of incident IS but not IHD and HS. 10,11",Kim_2017.txt,0
The differences in the results of these studies could be explained by the differences in the study population the study population size and the study duration; however these results strongly indicated different underlying mechanisms through which glucose dysregulation contributed to IHD IS and HS.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Moreover because few studies have addressed the prediabetes-vascular disease subtype association in terms of the related mortality our findings may provide a new insight into their relationship.,Kim_2017.txt,0
We demonstrated that prediabetes was strongly associated with IS mortality even after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors but not with IHD or HS mortality.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Interestingly our finding is in concurrence with the results of the large-scale Korean cohort study-the KNHS study which reported that prediabetes increased the incidence of IS alone and not the other vascular disease subtypes.,Kim_2017.txt,0
"The researchers explained that dysglycemia may have a more direct negative impact on IS as it comprises both micro-and macrovascular atherosclerotic lesions which is different from the predominately macrovascular lesions of IHD. 11,19",Kim_2017.txt,1
Another possible explanation is the ethnic difference.,Kim_2017.txt,0
The Asian population is more vulnerable to intracerebral vascular events than other populations; in a global comparative risk assessment study hyperglycemia-related stroke burden was significantly higher in Asians especially those from the East Asian region than in the Western population.,Kim_2017.txt,0
20 Moreover the number of IS deaths is higher in the East Asians than in the number of IHD deaths as has been shown in several Asian studies including this study.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Notably the increased susceptibility to IS rather than IHD among people with prediabetes has mostly been reported in studies conducted on Asian study cohorts.,Kim_2017.txt,0
"10,11,21",Kim_2017.txt,0
We further noted that the subjects with prediabetes in our study cohort possessed a relatively lean phenotype compared with those in the Western population.,Kim_2017.txt,0
"Most studies in the Western countries have shown that the BMI of prediabetic subjects was usually in the 25 to 30 kg/m 2 range 4,7,16,22 ; however the mean BMI of the IFG stage 2 group in our study cohort was only 24.2 kg/m 2 .",Kim_2017.txt,0
Because prediabetes is a group of highly heterogeneous phenotypes and metabolic states their cardiovascular risks are expected to vary depending on each individuals own risk factors.,Kim_2017.txt,1
The findings of The Global Burden of Metabolic Risk Factors for Chronic Disease Collaboration study provided important suggestions to interpret our results.,Kim_2017.txt,0
The study reported that obesity contributes differently to the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease; the effect of increasing BMI on the risk of vascular diseases was more pronounced on coronary heart disease than stroke and conversely the influence of metabolic mediators besides obesity was stronger on stroke than on coronary heart disease.,Kim_2017.txt,0
"23 Accordingly the increased susceptibility to stroke rather than IHD that we observed may partly be explained by the lean and metabolically unhealthy phenotype of the Asian prediabetics.""",Kim_2017.txt,0
As stated before prediabetes is a flexible metabolic state.,Kim_2017.txt,1
Large-scale observation studies have reported that ≈25% of the subjects with prediabetes regressed to NGT whereas another 25% progressed to overt DM over a 3-to 5-year follow-up period.,Kim_2017.txt,0
"24,25 Consequently most previous studies were fundamentally biased in not adjusting for the changing glucose tolerance state of the participants over time.",Kim_2017.txt,0
In this context the increased vascular disease risk observed only in the subjects who progressed to overt DM in the Hoorn study is suggestive.,Kim_2017.txt,0
We eliminated this bias in our study by using the counting process analyses which allowed the determination of glucose tolerance state as cases each year which could then reflect regression to NGT and progression to overt DM.,Kim_2017.txt,0
In fact using a traditional Cox regression analysis to examine our data we did not find an increased all-cause or cause-specific mortality risk in the IFG stage 2 group (data not shown).,Kim_2017.txt,0
This study still has several limitations.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Because of the lack of relevant data we could not use postprandial glucose or glycohemoglobin levels for analysis even though they reportedly associate more significantly with increased vascular disease risk.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Thus our results may not be generalizable to all subjects with prediabetes including isolated impaired glucose tolerance cases.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Next there exists a population bias in our study as we only used data from people who voluntarily participated in the health checkup programs and were thus probably more concerned about their health than those who did not participate in the checkups.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Finally we focused on mortality of each vascular diseases not the incidence of them.,Kim_2017.txt,0

"That study however had a relatively short follow-up time so that there were only 285 deaths among 1,370 study subjects.",Kim_2008.txt,0
Therefore death rates within the subcategories of impaired glucose regulation could not be examined.,Kim_2008.txt,0
This study extends previous observations in Pima Indians on the relationship between glucose concentration and mortality (18) to encompass a 29-year period.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Although diabetes has a major impact on IHD and mortality in Pima Indians the prevalence of IHD was not higher in the categories of IFG and/or IGT but only in those with Ͼ15 years of diabetes.,Kim_2008.txt,1
The associations of incident IHD with glucose/ diabetes categories (data not shown) were similar to those of prevalent IHD but the CIs for prevalent IHD were narrower because multiple examinations could be included in the generalized estimating equations and increased the power of the prevalent IHD analysis.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Furthermore mortality from natural causes or from IHD was not higher in individuals with IFG and/or IGT than in those with NGR in this study.,Kim_2008.txt,0
IHD and diabetic nephropathy share many risk factors and are the leading causes of death among diabetic Pima Indians.,Kim_2008.txt,1
Moreover people who develop diabetic nephropathy die primarily of IHD (10).,Kim_2008.txt,0
When death rates from diabetic nephropathy and IHD were computed as a composite end point the associations with glucose/diabetes categories were similar as with IHD alone (data not shown).,Kim_2008.txt,0
"These findings are consistent with the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (5) which included 6,888 white and black nondiabetic subjects and showed that neither IFG nor IGT increased the risk for all-cause mortality or incident IHD.",Kim_2008.txt,0
"Similarly in the Hoorn Study (6) increased risk associated with IFG or IGT was mostly but not completely attributable to cardiovascular risk factors in a population cohort of 2,363 subjects without known diabetes.",Kim_2008.txt,0
"By contrast in the DECODE (Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Europe) study (1) which included 22,514 subjects from a number of European population-based studies IGT but not IFG was associated with increased mortality from all causes and from CVD defined as IHD and stroke.",Kim_2008.txt,1
This relationship was present even after accounting for conventional cardio- vascular risk factors whereas in our study IFG and/or IGT did not increase the risk of death after controlling for age sex BMI total cholesterol mean blood pressure and smoking.,Kim_2008.txt,0
We computed mortality in subjects with IFG (with or without IGT) relative to NFG and in subjects with IGT (with or without IFG) relative to NGT categories that facilitated comparison with the Hoorn (6) and DECODE (1) studies.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Although neither of these categories were associated with statistically significantly higher natural-cause or IHD mortality rates the point estimates of effects were consistent with these previous studies.,Kim_2008.txt,0
For example in the current study the DRR for IHD mortality in IGT was 1.5 (95% CI 0.6 -3.5) compared with 1.3 (1.0 -1.6) in DECODE.,Kim_2008.txt,0
By contrast neither the Hoorn Study nor the present study provided evidence for an effect of IFG on mortality although the two studies used different definitions of IFG and classification of causes of death.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Compared with analyses using only baseline glucose categories to predict deaths in the time-dependent models the effect of diabetes on mortality was attenuated.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Indeed in the time-dependent models only subjects with diabetes of longer duration had significantly higher mortality than those with NGR.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Considering this difference reports of higher death rates from natural causes or IHD in subjects with IFG and/or IGT that are based solely on baseline glucose overestimate the effect of glucose in the nondiabetic range since some subjects in these groups could have developed diabetes after the baseline examination and yet remained in the nondiabetic group in the analysis.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Two studies examining the im-pact of development of diabetes on the increased risk for IHD morbidity and mortality in subjects with IFG or IGT reported conflicting results.,Kim_2008.txt,0
In the Finnish study (9) IGT remained an important risk factor even when controlled for the subsequent development of diabetes.,Kim_2008.txt,1
Subjects with IGT who did not develop diabetes after 10 years of follow-up had a 49% higher risk of incident IHD and a 65% higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with NGT.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Conversely in the Hoorn Study the excess mortality associated with IFG was present only in those who developed diabetes during follow-up (8).,Kim_2008.txt,0
The Hoorn Study included follow-up glucose measurements whereas the Finnish study relied on the registered drug  data or ICD codes provided by the national Hospital Discharge Register for identifying new cases of diabetes.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Therefore the Finnish study was more likely to include undiagnosed diabetic subjects in the IGT group.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Thus failure to account for progression to diabetes may result in incorrect conclusions about the pathogenetic importance of IFG and IGT in relation to IHD and mortality.,Kim_2008.txt,0
"Several studies (3,19) have indicated a lower glycemic threshold for macrovascular than for microvascular disease.",Kim_2008.txt,0
"This was not evident in the Pima Indians (18,20) (i.e. the risk of these complications was increased in subjects with diabetes but not in those with lesser degrees of glucose abnormality).",Kim_2008.txt,0
This finding may be due to the much lower rate of IHD in nondiabetic Pimas than in many other populations (20).,Kim_2008.txt,0
Low serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol and a low rate of heavy smoking (20) may be responsible in part for these differences.,Kim_2008.txt,0
"Indeed only 22 nondiabetic IHD deaths occurred in Ͼ17,000 person-years of follow-up during the 29-year study period.",Kim_2008.txt,0
With low rates of traditional risk factors for macrovascular disease diabetes especially when accompanied by renal complications may represent the predominant risk factor for IHD.,Kim_2008.txt,1
This impact of diabetic nephropathy enhances the association of diabetes duration with the incidence of IHD.,Kim_2008.txt,0
Lower glucose concentration has also been previously associated with CVD and natural mortality (3).,Kim_2008.txt,0
Although not statistically significant there was 50% higher natural-cause mortality in those with FPG Ͻ4.5 mmol/l than those with FPG 4.5-5.5 mmol/l.,Kim_2008.txt,1

Additional adjustment for behavioral and socioeconomic covariates (smoking alcohol exercise area of residence and salary level) did not substantively alter the strength of any of these associations.,Sung_2009.txt,0
With additional adjustment for BP BMI and total cholesterol level however there was marked attenuation of associations for MI and IHS and clear increased risk was only seen for those in the category that combined diabetes with a FBG Ն7.5 mmol/L.,Sung_2009.txt,1
The hazard ratio (95% CI) of MI for this group compared with the reference group of 4.6 to 5.0 mmol/L in the fully adjusted model was 1.79 (1.59 2.02) and that for IHS was 1.36 (1.18 1.58).,Sung_2009.txt,1
When men with previously diagnosed diabetes were excluded from the analysis no association of FBG with IHS was observed in the fully adjusted model but the increased risk of MI (that was observed when men with diabetes were included in the highest FBG category) remained for those men in the highest (Ն7.5 mmol/L) FBG category (Figure).,Sung_2009.txt,0
The association between FBG and IS was somewhat attenuated with full adjustment for covariates but even in this model the risk of IS started to increase from the current cutoff FBG level (Ն5.6 mmol/L) of impaired fasting glucose (Table 2).,Sung_2009.txt,1
The increase in IS risk from this FBG level was also seen in analyses that excluded men with a previous diagnosis of diabetes (Figure).,Sung_2009.txt,0

Crude mortality rates for people without carbohydrate metabolism disorders were the lowest compared to those of people with prediabetes known T2D and unknown T2D (Table 2 and Fig 1).,Ares_2019.txt,0
The age-and sex-adjusted mortality risks were almost equal in the NGT and prediabetes groups and higher in subjects with previously undiagnosed T2D; however the risks were not as high as for known T2D at baseline (Table 2).,Ares_2019.txt,0
After multivariable adjustment people with known T2D had a mortality rate (MR) more than two-fold greater than people in the NGT group (2.02 [95% CI 1.29-3.16]); whereas for people with undiagnosed T2D the MR was 1.51-times higher (95% CI 1.00-2.28) (Fig 2).,Ares_2019.txt,0
The risk of death in those with T2D both diagnosed and undiagnosed versus those without dysglycemia was 1.71 (95% CI 1.25-2.34) in the multivariate model and 1.78 (95% CI 1.31-2.42) in the model adjusted for age and sex.],Ares_2019.txt,0

Cancer mortality was also increased in people with known T2D especially in men; however it was not statistically different (Fig 4).,Ares_2019.txt,0
People younger than 45 years with T2D (both diagnosed and unknown) had a strongly increased mortality risk compared to the NGT group of the same age.,Ares_2019.txt,0

In this population cohort study we found that DM was a risk factor for CVD stroke and CHD whereas an IFG of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol l À1 was a risk factor for CVD and CHD only.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
A combined effect of IFG and prehypertension on the incidence of CVD was observed.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
The high-normal BP subjects in any glucose category and the normal BP subjects with IFG in the Japanese population showed increased risks of CVD.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0

Iso et al. 20 reported that glucose abnormalities were a risk factor for ischemic stroke in a Japanese population by using nonfasting glucose levels.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0

34 Compared with previous studies our study has several methodological strengths.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
First our cohort population was relatively large and was selected at random from an urban population in contrast to most other cohort populations in Asia which were selected from rural populations.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
"15,20,34 Second all of our cohort participants were examined at one place and measured using the same autoanalyzer at one laboratory.",Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Finally our study examined the risk of CVD incidence not CVD mortality.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
In our study we used the definitions of IFG and CVD/CHD set forth by the 2003 American Diabetes Association recommendations.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
In the Framingham Heart Study the 2003 IFG definition was predictive of CHD in women but not in men 17 a finding which was similar to our results.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
However fewer studies have examined the association of the 2003 IFG definitions for CHD and stroke.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
Kanaya et al. 35 showed that the 2003 defination for IFG was not associated with increased risk of CHD or stroke among postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
Kim et al. 36 reported that one-third of the population has IFG according to the 2003 definition.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
However many of these individuals do not have increased prevalence of CHD.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Hu et al. 19 reported that hypertension and DM increased stroke risk independently and that their combination additively increased stroke risk.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
In our study the risks of CVD in the normoglycemic and IFG groups were linearly related to the BP category (P-value for trendo0.001).,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
However the risks of CVD in the DM group did not change with BP category (P-value for trend¼0.4) which was compatible with a previous result for trends between glucose category and hypertension status.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
20 Recently the ACCORD BP Study has shown that targeting an SBP o120 mm Hg as opposed to an SBP o140 mm Hg did not reduce the rate of a composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
37,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Although present studies suggest that decreasing BP may be an effective way to prevent CVD in normoglycemic or IFG subjects further investigations are required to clarify the interaction between the BP categories of DM subjects at risk for CVD in other large cohorts.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
The percentage of the PAF for CVD incidence in normoglycemic subjects with high-normal BP or IFG subjects with normal or highnormal BP (PAF¼12.6%) was 1.5 times higher than that in the DM subjects in any BP category (PAF¼8.2%).,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
the PAF suggested that 12.6% of CVD cases would be preventable if the borderline glucose and blood pressure levels were controlled to within normoglycemic and optimal BP ranges.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Our results showed that hyperglycemia conferred a slightly higher risk of CVD incidence in women than in men although men had greater absolute event rates for CVD.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Previous studies have shown that the impact of DM on the risk of CVD is significantly greater in women than in men.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0

Lee et al. reported that the HRs of coronary heart disease for DM were 2.6 for women and 1.9 for men.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
In the Framingham Heart Study 17 IFG was associated with increased CHD risk only in women (HR¼1.7; 95% CI 1.0-3.0).,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
The reason for these sex differences in the association between DM and CVD remains unclear.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Our study has several limitations.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
The primary limitation is the regression dilution bias; this study was based on a single day measurement of serum glucose and BP levels.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
39,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
That is the fasting serum glucose and BP levels might have been misclassified.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Second as we did not perform glucose tolerance tests we may have missed subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Finally we did not examine the combined effect of BP categories and glucose abnormalities after stratification by CVD subtypes such as stroke and CHD because of the small sample size.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
In conclusion DM is a risk factor for CVD stroke and CHD whereas an IFG of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol l À1 is a risk factor for CVD and CHD in women.,Kokubo_2010.txt,1
The risks of CVD in the normoglycemic and IFG groups were linearly related to the BP category.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
The high-normal BP subjects in any glucose categories and the normal BP subjects with IFG showed increased risks of CVD in this Japanese population.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
Further investigations of larger cohorts of DM subjects are needed.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0
The results of this study showed that diabetes increases the risk of CHD events in Japan regardless of the presence or absence of medication to treat diabetes.,Saito_2011.txt,0
We showed that diabetes was strongly associated with both non-fatal and fatal CHD events.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Moreover fasting glucose levels in the range of 5.6-6.9 mmol/l defined as IFG increased the risk of CHD.,Saito_2011.txt,1
PAF for fatal and non-fatal CHD events due to diabetes was around 6% in the general population.,Saito_2011.txt,0
The influence of a pre-diabetic state on the risk of CHD events in Japan has been difficult to demonstrate in the past because the low number of CHD events reduces the statistical power to show a significant association.,Saito_2011.txt,0
The Hisayama study (n = 2421) in Japan reported that the risk of coronary heart disease for women with fasting glucose levels ≥,Saito_2011.txt,0
7.0 mmol/l was increased 5.3-fold; however the risk of diabetic men and individuals with IFG was not elevated [8].,Saito_2011.txt,1
Similarly the Funagata study (n = 2938) in Japan did not find that IFG increased the risk of CHD events [9].,Saito_2011.txt,0
Of note our prospective study suggests that IFG was associated with CHD although the presence of traditional risk factors such as smoking and hypertension diminished the strength of this association.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Furthermore fasting glucose levels were associated with CHD events in a linear manner.,Saito_2011.txt,0
In contrast non-fasting glucose levels of 7.8-11.0 mmol/l were moderately associated with CHD events.,Saito_2011.txt,1
This implies that individuals with elevated glucose levels after the last meal are at increased risk which supports the finding of a previous study that IGT was a predictor of death from cardiovascular disease [15].,Saito_2011.txt,1
In the JPHC study treated diabetics had an elevated risk of CHD events that was similar to the risk of untreated diabetics.,Saito_2011.txt,0
The explanation for this may be that treated diabetics had a higher glucose burden for a longer period of time and worse diabetes than untreated diabetics.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Furthermore although we did not assess the duration or severity of diabetes treated diabetics including individuals with insulin therapy were likely to have other conditions that cause progression of atherosclerosis [16].,Saito_2011.txt,0
"Previous studies have shown that trends in the incidence and mortality rates of MI declined in the last few decades in the US and Canada [17,18] and this was explained by a reduction of cholesterol levels and an improvement in lifestyle.",Saito_2011.txt,0
In contrast the rates in China have increased [19] and this is explained by an increase in blood cholesterol levels due to adoption of a Westernized diet and lifestyle.,Saito_2011.txt,0
In Japan an epidemiological study suggested that validated mortality rates from CHD were stable from 1987 to 1998 [20]; however the trend in CHD incidence appeared to increase in the 1960s and level off in the 1990s [21].,Saito_2011.txt,0
Westernized lifestyles such as a high intake of animal fat and a low level of physical activity rapidly spread in Japan between the 1960s and the 1980s [22] and this may have contributed to the increase in rates during this time period.,Saito_2011.txt,1
We found that the PAF of CHD events due to diabetes was 6.3% which was similar to the effect of the metabolic syndrome [23].,Saito_2011.txt,0
Recently a Japanese urban cohort in 1989-1994 documented that the PAF of cardiovascular disease due to diabetes was 8.2% [24].,Saito_2011.txt,0
Similarly the Framingham Heart study reported that the PAF was 8.7% in the 1975-1998 cohort [25].,Saito_2011.txt,0
Nonetheless since the prevalence of diabetes has recently been increasing in Japan the PAF observed in the present study might increase in the future.,Saito_2011.txt,0
The strength of this study is that it was a large populationbased study that was representative of all of Japan and systematic surveys of CHD events were performed.,Saito_2011.txt,0
However several limitations should be noted.,Saito_2011.txt,0
First we did not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the present study.,Saito_2011.txt,0
However our participants were recruited from individuals in the general population who received annual health checkups; therefore we believe that the majority of participants treated for diabetes had type 2 diabetes.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Second the percentage of non-fasting blood samples was 57.5%.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Therefore the diagnosis of diabetes in these participants might have been underestimated because there were fewer subjects with non-fasting glucose levels ≥11.1 mmol/l when compared with the prevalence of individuals with 2-h post-load glucose levels ≥11.1 mmol/l.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Third we analyzed data from both sexes combined because the statistical power was not sufficient to compute sexspecific hazard ratios.,Saito_2011.txt,0
However we confirmed that there was no interaction of sex with the increased risk of CHD events.,Saito_2011.txt,0
In conclusion diabetes was strongly associated with incident fatal and non-fatal CHD regardless of the use of medication to treat diabetes in middle-aged Japanese.,Saito_2011.txt,0
Also there was a trend for individuals with IFG to have an increased risk of CHD events in Japan.,Saito_2011.txt,0
The main fi nding in this large population-based prospective study was that newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (NDM) and known diabetes mellitus (KDM) but not impaired glucose regulation (IGR) were associated with fatal CAD in both women and men.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
In gender comparisons the higher CAD mortality observed among men compared with women became gradually and consistently weaker as the abnormal glucose regulation became more advanced and this attenuation was evident already in people with IGR.],Madssen_2012.txt,0
[We found that both men and women with abnormal glucose regulation were older and had a higher prevalence of known cardiovascular disease hypertension and obesity than people with NGR.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
We also found that women with abnormal glucose regulation were older and had a higher BMI than their male a Adjusted for age (continuous) BMI ( Ͻ 18.5 18.5 -24.9 25.0 -29.9 Ն 30.0 kg/m 2 ) hypertension (no yes) established cardiovascular disease (no yes) smoking habits (never former current unknown) and exercise sessions per week ( Ͻ 1 1 Ն 2 unknown).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
counterparts.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
These fi ndings could explain the higher mortality from CAD associated with abnormal glucose regulation and the female disadvantage of dysglycemia.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
However the multivariable adjustment did not substantially attenuate the HRs of fatal CAD associated with dysglycemia.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
"These fi ndings are consistent with the results of others (1,15,16) implying that intrinsic factors related to the hyperglycaemic process may be important for the increased CAD mortality in people with disturbances in the glucose metabolism.",Madssen_2012.txt,0
We also found that people with abnormal glucose regulation smoked less than people with NGR and that women smoked less than men.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
This suggests that smoking was not a likely factor for the gender-differences in CAD mortality in people with abnormal glucose regulation.],Madssen_2012.txt,0
"[We observed that both NDM and KDM are associated with fatal CAD and these fi ndings are consistent with those of previous studies (1,4).",Madssen_2012.txt,0
The multivariable association of IGR with fatal CAD showed 20 percent higher risk in both genders but the associations were not statistically signifi cant possibly due to a low number of women and men in the IGR group.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Few other studies have investigated longterm CAD specifi c mortality in people with prediabetic conditions including both patients with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Generally impaired glucose tolerance is suggested to be a better predictor of clinical events than impaired fasting glucose (17).,Madssen_2012.txt,1
However in a study of patients with known CAD impaired fasting glucose was associated with increased risk of all-cause death and death from CAD during 7.7 years of follow-up (18) and a recent large meta-analysis (19) reported that impaired fasting glucose was associated with 17% increased (HR 1.17 CI 1.08 -1.26) risk of death from CAD.],Madssen_2012.txt,1
"[""We observed that the higher CAD mortality observed among men compared with women became gradually and consistently weaker as glucose regulation status became more advanced (Table III).",Madssen_2012.txt,0
The weakening of HRs in men was evident already in people with IGR and was further reduced in patients with NDM.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
In people with KDM the gender difference in mortality from CAD was strongly attenuated (HR 1.2 CI 1.0 -1.5 in men).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
"Our fi ndings in people with KDM have previously been published in a separate analysis ( 7) and are supported by other studies (8,12).",Madssen_2012.txt,0
In the present study the gender difference in risk of fatal CAD was less pronounced in people with NDM than KDM.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
This suggests that the duration of prevalent diabetes may be in disfavor for women as shown in the Nurses  Health Study where there was a strong positive association of duration of diabetes with mortality in women (9).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Whether the presence of IGR diminishes the female advantage related to CAD mortality has not been extensively studied and as far as we know there are no original studies published on this topic.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
In a meta-analysis based on the DECODE study allcause mortality was increased in both women and men with IGR but cardiovascular mortality was not.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
The absolute gender difference in cardiovascular mortality declined in the IGR group compared with normoglycemic people (8) corresponding to our fi ndings (Table III).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
"This supports the hypothesis that any hyperglycemia also below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus may attenuate the usual protective effect of the female gender in CAD mortality and should therefore be prevented.""",Madssen_2012.txt,0
Why hyperglycaemia should be a stronger risk factor for CAD in women than men is not completely understood.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
However given that abnormal glucose regulation in patients with CAD is more prevalent in women than in men (20) this is an important topic.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Most studies trying to explain this phenomenon have compared patients with diabetes and no diabetes without differentiating between people with NGR and IGR.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
It is suggested that diabetes has a greater adverse effect on triglyceride and lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in women than in men (21) which may accelerate atherosclerosis to a greater extent in women.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
It has also been reported that endothelial function an important mechanism in atherogenesis may be more impaired in women with diabetes than their male counterparts (22).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
In the DECODE study (8) diabetes was more strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality in women than in men among patients who smoked were overweight or had dyslipidemia or hypertension.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
That fi nding could suggest that synergistic effects between cardiovascular risk factors could be stronger in diabetic women diabetic men.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
It has also been proposed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to adverse outcomes in CAD could differ by gender (23) and that treatment strategies may therefore be less effective in women.],Madssen_2012.txt,0
[Apart from the clear strengths by the large sample size and long-term follow-up the present work has some limitations.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
There are factors that may have led to an underestimation of the association between the three groups of abnormal glucose regulation and fatal CAD in our study.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
The initial blood glucose measurement was conducted in a nonfasting state and only people with a random nonfasting blood glucose concentration Ն 8 mmol/L were scheduled for a fasting follow-up test.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
If all blood glucose measurements had been conducted in a fasting state more people with IGR and NDM would probably have been identifi ed.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
This could explain why we did not fi nd a statistically signifi cant association between IGR and fatal CAD.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Also during 18 years of follow-up the prevalence of diabetes and obesity increased in the study population (24).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Thus it is likely that also the prevalence of IGR would have increased leading to a larger number of people in the categories IGR and KDM during follow-up.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
Diabetes was defi ned by self-reporting which could underestimate the prevalence.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
However it has been demonstrated that self-reporting of diabetes in the HUNT population was correct in 96.5% (25).,Madssen_2012.txt,0
We do not have data on serum lipids in our study population and it is possible that adjustment for lipids in the multivariable analyses would lead to attenuation of the HRs of fatal CAD in people within the three groups of abnormal glucose regulation.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
In addition adjusting for lipids could have differential effects in women and men.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
On the other hand it can be argued that adjustment for lipids in people with IGR or diabetes is inappropriate as dyslipidemia is a part of the diabetic process itself.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
To the best of our knowledge this is among the first studies to examine the impact of different combination of glucose tolerance and BP status with CVD and all-cause mortality during more than a decade follow-up.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
In comparison to the reference the hypertensive groups in the presence of diabetes showed a significant risk of more than twofold for CVD/CHD and all-cause mortality events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Furthermore the pre-HTN and DM group showed a significant risk of about 70% for CVD events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
The NTN and DM group highlighted a 100% increased risk for mortality events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Finally the NTN and pre-DM group showed about 50% increased risk in multivariate analysis for CVD/CHD events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Although DM and HTN are well-known risk factors for CVD and all-cause mortality events population-based studies examining the impact of different combinations of glucose tolerance and BP status on these outcomes are scarce.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Similar to our findings a population-based study conducted in China showed significant risk for CVD events for HTN groups whether per se alone or in the presence of glucose intolerance status.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
18,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
In the current study the presence of pre-HTN increased the risk of CVD by about 71% among the population with DM.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
The researchers of the Strong heart study showed HR 42 for patients with DM in the presence of NTN or pre-HTN status only for CVD events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
17 Pre-HTN as a pre-disease risk factor was reported to be associated with CVD/CHD but not all-cause mortality events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
8 Among Iranian adults we previously found that the risk of pre-HTN for CVD events was limited to middle aged population.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
9,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
In another study conducted among Turkish population it was also shown the independent risk of pre-HN for CHD as well as DM only among women.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
22,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
In the current study we extended our findings and showed that among different phenotypes of glucose tolerance status the CVD risk of pre-HTN was found only among those with DM.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
"Unlike to the studies conducted among American and Chinese population 17,18 we found a risk of about 50% for CVD events among the pre-DM population in the presence of BP o120/80 mm Hg. Recent meta-analysis conducted by Xu et al. 12 showed that the risk of CHD was increased in participants with impaired fasting glucose tolerance defined by the American Diabetes Association or WHO criteria.",Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
On the other hand among non-diabetic Turkish population it was shown that the impact of impaired fasting glucose was modulated by the presence of metabolic syndrome; 23 on the other hand impaired glucose tolerance alone independently predicted CHD risk among women.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
24 Data from 19 European cohorts including 12 566 men and 10 874 women with both FPG and 2 h-PCPG within the normoglycemic range showed high 2 h-PCPG was associated  increased CVD mortality.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
25,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
In the current study we defined pre-DM as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance and did not stratify the pre-DM group considering the limited number of events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
The current study extends findings of previous studies by showing all-cause mortality as the outcome of interest in which we observed increased risk in all of the individuals with HTN regardless of glucose tolerance status.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
"Although association of HTN with all-cause and CVD mortality is not a new finding 26,27 our study clarifies that this association persists even in those with NGT.",Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Furthermore we showed that compared with NFG/NGT population BP o 120/80 mm,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Hg among diabetic individuals not on antihypertensive medications increased all-cause mortality risk by about 100% although the diabetic population with pre-HTN had no significant risk.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
In line with our study the recent Kailuan Study conducted among a Chinese diabetic population showed that baseline BP o 120/80mm,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Hg was significantly associated with incident all-cause mortality but not with CVD relative to BP of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg. 16 Table 1 shows that among the study population NTN patients with type 2 DM are more likely to be male and smoker and have higher FPG but lower BMI compared to the other groups.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
Furthermore we showed that among the diabetic population being male having lower BMI or high FPG and being a smoker were independent risk factors for mortality events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
28 Moreover diabetic patients may experience other diseases such as infection that result in impaired cardiac output and abnormal vasodilatation showing a decrease in blood pressure.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
29 Hence as reported by WU Z et al. a relatively low BP may reveal the evolution toward complex diabetic comorbidities and mortality.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
In the current study we extend the results of WU Z et al. by showing a similar trend among a pre-DM population with BP o 120/80 with increased risk of 48% for CVD whereas the presence of pre-HTN with pre-DM was not associated with any risk.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Regarding the presence of both pre-DM and pre-HTN the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found US adults showing this phenotype had a worse CVD risk profile 30 with authors concluding that these populations are on an accelerated pathway to early CVD events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
"Despite the high prevalence and incidence of pre-HTN and pre-DM among Iranian populations 4,5 however we found no risk in our population with coexisting pre-HTN and pre-DM for CVD and mortality outcomes.",Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Importantly these findings should be interpreted with caution; in fact the statistical power of study was 43% to detect HR of 1.27 of pre-HTN and pre-DM groups for CVD.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
To mention the study limitations first as inherent in any prospective study level of risk factors at the baseline examination might have changed during the follow-up period.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
As such some degree of misclassification might have occurred leading to biased estimated HRs toward the null.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Second our definitions for DM did not include HbA1c so it is possible that some cases not diagnosed using FPG or 2 h-PCPG may have been missed.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Third we did not sex-stratify our data analysis considering the absence of interactions between gender and different categories of glucose tolerance and blood pressure for different outcomes as shown in other studies.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
[17][18][19],Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Fourth this study has been conducted on a sample of Iranian population living in Tehran and further studies should be conducted to determine whether our findings could be applicable to other populations.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
As strengths this is among the first studies to examine the impact of different combinations of glycemic levels and BP status with all-cause mortality outcomes and the third one regarding CVD/CHD.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Also the length of followup and using actual measurements of variables and outcomes rather than self-reported data are other strengths of this study.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Furthermore we used both FPG and 2 h-PCPG to categorise our participants into the pre-DM and NGT groups.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
To conclude HTN caused significant increase in risk of CVD/CHD and all-cause mortality regardless of glucose tolerance status indicating the importance of controlling HTN for CVD prevention even among NGT populations.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Furthermore we showed that blood pressure o 120/80 mm Hg among pre-diabetic and diabetic populations not on antihypertensive medications was generally associated with worse health outcomes.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
And the last but not least the presence of both pre-disease states was not associated with any risk for CVD/CHD or mortality.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
Considering the observational nature of this study these findings should be confirmed in context of clinical trials for obtaining definite conclusion.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
What is known about the topic?,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
•,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
It is well-known that hypertension and diabetes have significant role in cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
What this study adds?,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,0
• Hypertension is associated with increased risk of CVD and mortality events regardless of glucose tolerance status.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
The presence of both pre-diabetes and pre-hypertension was not associated with any risk for CVD/CHD or mortality events.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
• Blood pressure o120/80 mm Hg among pre-diabetic/diabetic population not on antihypertensive medications was generally associated with worse health outcomes.,Hajebrahimi_2017.txt,1
In the elderly IGT is not uncommon: the prevalence has been between 20 and 29% in previous studies [18][19][20].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,1
In our study the prevalence of IGT was lower 12.3% (95% CI ±2.0%) but our study excluded institutionalised patients.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
IGT is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes with 20-50% of individuals developing type 2 diabetes over 10 years [21].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,1
The prevalence of diabetes among acute stroke patients has increased over the years [22].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Also the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and IGT is high among stroke patients; according to a Chinese study the overall prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 33.5% and IGT was 21.0% [23].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
In our study the prevalence of DM among stroke patients was nearly the same i.e. 31.9% but the prevalence of IGT was lower 13.5%.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
In view of the high prevalence of DM and IGT among stroke patients screening for diabetes is recommended especially in those with ischaemic stroke.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
However the number of cases in our study was too small to show a 5% difference in stroke incidence between normal group and IGT group statistically significant.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
It seems that the atherosclerotic process in cerebral vessels caused by hyperglycaemia is slower in IGT than in clinical DM which was a strong risk factor for stroke development in our study.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
The association between IGT and stroke may also be underestimated because of other causes of death particularly deaths from coronary heart disease [24] which generally occur earlier in life and with a greater frequency than deaths from stroke [25] and also share some common risk factors with stroke.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
There are some limitations in our study.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
"The greatest one of them is the fact that the number studied (n = 1,032) was small because the Turku Elderly Study was a cohort study.",Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
We also excluded institutionalised patients in our study and thus those who participated tended to be healthier than those who were excluded.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
This fact may limit the generalisation of the findings only to the home-dwelling elderly people.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Second among those who were not diagnosed as diabetic patients only one measurement each of fasting and 2-h glucose was available.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
This method is standard for most epidemiological studies.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
According to American Diabetes Association clinical practice guidelines a diagnosis of diabetes requires a confirmation of elevated glucose measures on a subsequent day [26].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,1
Because an elevated glucose measure was not confirmed by a second measure we cannot be certain that any glucose classification was correct and not the result of random fluctuations in glycaemia.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Third the linkage of computerised records (i.e. Hospital Discharge and Death Registers) for epidemiological purposes are of course to be viewed with some caution.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
However the feasibility of these registers for epidemiological studies on stroke in Finland is found to be fairly reliable and a validation study has been done [27].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Fourth we have no information on the amount of specific imaging investigations.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
On the basis of the FINSTROKE Study in the year 1998 the combination of CT MRI and autopsy approached 100% in Finland [15].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
"It is to be noted that the Turku Elderly Study was started in the year 1990 and the acceptable levels of blood pressure among the elderly were far higher than today because the results of SHEP Syst-Eur and other studies were not available then [28,29].",Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
In those days hypertension was regarded as poorly controlled if systolic was >160 mmHg or diastolic >95 mmHg.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,1
Of course nowadays the target pressure in older people is much lower.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
However there is still plenty of room for improvements in the implementation of guidelines in clinical practice.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
"Table 1. Patient characteristics among 1,032 patients aged 70 years with and without subsequent stroke during the 12-year follow-up a Normal defined as fasting plasma glucose level <7.0; IGT defined 2 h after administration of 75 g of an oral glucose load plasma glucose level of between 7.80 and 11.09 mmol/l; DM defined as the current use of insulin or an oral hypoglycaemic medication a fasting plasma glucose level of ≥7 mmol/l or a plasma glucose level of ≥11.1 mmol/l 2 h after administration of an oral glucose load.",Kaarisalo_2006.txt,1
From a public health perspective identification of individuals with elevated glucose levels may provide an opportunity for intervention.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
However effective screening for IGT by oral glucose tolerance test in elderly people is a rather laborious method.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
According to our study in view of stroke prevention in the elderly IGT has no predictive value beyond knowledge of standard CVD risk factors.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
However if IGT patients are identified they should be advised about modifying their lifestyle in view of preventing DM and screened and treated for other cardiovascular risk factors.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Is IGT assuming a more predominant role in stroke occurrence?,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Population trends in risk factors for stroke show significant improvements in hypertension detection treatment and control declines in the levels of cholesterol and the prevalence of cigarette smoking [30].,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
It is plausible therefore that the proportion of strokes attributable to IGT may be increasing given the increase in the prevalence of diabetes and IGT in general population.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
Future studies to clear the relationship between IGT and stroke in elderly people are needed.],Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
[• Stroke tended to happen more often in the IGT group than in the normal group but the difference was not statistically significant.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
• Risk factors for stroke in elderly people are previous TIA or stroke and DM.,Kaarisalo_2006.txt,0
In this population-based study from the Middle East we highlight sex-specific associations between prediabetes definitions and major clinical outcomes over a decade long follow-up.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Our results indicate the associations of IFG-ADA with CKD and IFG-WHO with stroke only among men and the associations of IFG-ADA with incident hypertension and IGT with CHD only among women.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Using any definition of prediabetes in both genders increased the risk of incident T2D to more than four-fold.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
The progression rates of IFG-ADA IFG-WHO and IGT to overt T2D either among men or among women in our study (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) were generally higher than the corresponding values in the whole population from a large meta-analysis which documented incidence rates of 35.5 47.4 and 45.5 per 1000 person-years respectively.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
21,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
As expected all definitions of prediabetes were associated with incident T2D 2  and confirming a previous study from China risk of T2D was similar between men and women.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
22 Regarding CKD to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to find a significant association with IFG-ADA which was only present among men.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
A recent meta-analysis reported 11% increase in the risk of CKD with IFG-WHO 4 yet with marked heterogeneity and no sex-separated analysis studies.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
In agreement with our sex-adjusted results (Supplementary Table 4) the only study including both genders and adequate adjustments for IFG-WHO and the two studies on IFG-ADA found no significant association with CKD in the whole population from other ethnicities.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
4 The sex-difference pointed out by our findings is in line with previous observations in the general population indicating an association between male gender with adverse renal outcomes.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
23,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
This might be explained by the protective effect of female sex hormones; 24 however this effect seems to disappear in diabetic women probably because of hormone imbalance in a hyperglycemic environment 25 as diabetic men and women have shown similar risk of CKD.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
24,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Our previous results from Tehranian adults indicated a dramatic increased risk of CKD among women with known diabetes whereas undiagnosed diabetes only increased the risk among men.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
13 Considering that patients with known diabetes have probably been under the effect of hyperglycemia for a longer period these observations could indicate the potential importance of duration of hyperglycemia in its harmful renal effects in women.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
To illuminate this matter further studies are desired to consider the impact of duration of prediabetes in its association with incident CKD in each gender.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Regarding the association of IGT with CKD studies are too scarce to be conclusive.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
"4,26",Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
In this study we failed to find any association between IGT and CKD as defined by eGFR decline.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Previously a higher prevalence of albuminuria an early marker of CKD has been shown in IGT compared with normoglycemia.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
27 Moreover IGT but not IFG has been associated with glomerular hyperfiltration.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
28,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Therefore investigating the association of IGT with albuminuria is recommended for future studies.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
For incident hypertension we showed 24% increased risk among women with IFG-ADA; yet no definitions of IFG were associated with hypertension among men.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
Insulin resistance could lead to hypertension through several mechanisms including sympathetic stimulation and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
15,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
The observed sex-difference in the association of IFG with hypertension is in line with our previous study where insulin resistance parameters were only associated with incident hypertension among women.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
10 Previously a Korean cohort 6 and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 5 failed to find any independent associations between IFG-ADA with incident hypertension.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Yet none of these studies documented sex-separated analyses.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Contrasting our findings among TLGS men the Osaka Health Survey on Japanese men indicated a positive association between IFG-WHO and hypertension.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
29,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
However the study lacked adjustment for central adiposity an important confounding factor in the association between insulin resistance and hypertension 15 especially among men.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
10,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
To our knowledge this is the first evidence of a sexspecific association between IFG-ADA with hypertension independent of general or central adiposity.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Our findings are in line with previous studies suggesting a dominant link between insulin resistance arterial stiffness and hypertension among women compared with men probably under the of sex hormones.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
"9,10,30",Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Yet further studies are required to confirm the sexdifference and underlying mechanisms.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
The IGT phenotype in the current study as well as in the study by Lee et al. increased the risk of hypertension more than 20% which did not remain significant after multivariate adjustments.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
6 Considering that both studies have adjusted for similar confounders including anthropometric measures and lipid profile this suggests that IGT may not have a true effect on incident hypertension independent of other cardiometabolic risk factors.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Regarding cardiovascular events many studies have considered composite CVD as the outcome.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
7 Yet there may be different associations between prediabetes with CHD and stroke masking each other when combined as composite CVD.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
31 Recently in a large meta-analysis Huang et al. 7 showed that IFG-ADA IFG-WHO and IGT all increased the risk of CHD (by relative risks of 1.10 1.18 and 1.20 respectively) and stroke (by relative risks of 1.06 1.17 and 1.20 respectively).,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
It is noticeable that despite the high risk of CVD and its risk factors in the Middle East 14 eligible studies from this region were scarce.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Moreover only few studies presented sex-separated analyses.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
In our study despite the low number of events IFG-WHO increased the risk of stroke among men and IGT increased CHD risk among women both with hazard ratios comparable to undiagnosed diabetes.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
"Regarding CHD our results are in line with the previous studies from Europe and Asia indicating a stronger link with IGT compared with IFG. 32,33",Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
However in contrast to our findings on sex-difference the DECODE study recruiting data from 10 European prospective cohorts demonstrated a stronger association between IGT and CHD-related mortality among men than among women.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
32,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Yet our results follow the previous research indicating a higher impact of hyperglycemia on cardiac structure among non-diabetic women 34 and a higher incidence of CHD among diabetic women compared with their male counterparts.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
"35 Regarding stroke our findings build on previous studies conducted among non-diabetic men from Korea and the USA which demonstrated a markedly increased risk of stroke with rising FPG above the WHO cutoff 31,36 and confirm the results of Kim et al. indicating that the association exists only among men and not among women.",Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
37,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
"However studies from Japan failed to find any association between IFG-ADA/-WHO with ischemic stroke for either gender 38,39 despite increased risk of stroke-mortality in men and CHD-mortality in women with known diabetes.",Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
40 Regarding IGT similar to our study population no association was found with stroke among Japanese adults.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
39 Overall the disparities between studies on stroke could be due to ethnicity different definitions of outcome (e.g. all stroke vs. ischemic stroke) or the variety in covariate adjustments.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Last in our population none of the prediabetes definitions were significantly associated with all-cause mortality and no sex-difference was found.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Our findings were partly in line with the recent meta-analysis by Huang et al.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
7 who reported no sex-difference in the association of prediabetes definitions with mortality; however unlike our results they concluded significant increased risk of mortality by 13% with IFG-ADA and -WHO and by 32% with IGT.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
Generally studies on the association of IGT with mortality have been more consistent and documented stronger associations than studies on IFG.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
7 Similarly in our population compared with IFG IGT showed stronger associations with mortality with aHRs of 1.18 (0.88-1.64) among men and 1.26 (0.83-1.90) among women; yet our study power to detect the significance of these associations was around 25%.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
As it has been argued for the sex-differences in complications of insulin resistance and overt T2D it is not yet clear whether these differences are solely due to intrinsic and biological mechanisms or whether environmental factors such as risk factor control and lifestyle also play a role.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
11 Further studies are essential to clarify these gender-differences among different populations and investigate the underlying mechanisms.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Eventually if confirmed these results could suggest the need for sexspecific definitions of prediabetes and subsequently sexspecific approaches to its management.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
The most important strengths of this study are the prospective population-based design with long-term follow-up reasonable size of population providing data on both FPG and 2h-PCPG levels and for both sexes accurate data measurements at baseline and continuous surveillance for major outcomes which were ascertained by an adjudication committee.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Moreover this is among the first studies to highlight sexdifferences in the association of prediabetes with major clinical outcomes and the first to our knowledge to find sex-specific associations between IFG-ADA and CKD and hypertension.],Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
[Most importantly in this study we did not account for the changes in prediabetes status during follow-up.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
"Hence like many relevant studies 31,33,39 we were unable to tell whether the observed risks were due to prediabetes per se or its progression to diabetes.",Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
As this was a hypothesis driven exploratory study adjustments for multiple testing were not performed to avoid obscuring potentially true associations.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
"18,20",Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
In fact we intended to limit type II error (incorrect confirmation of the null hypothesis) which would increase with multiple testing in exchange for a decrease in type I error.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
However our findings need to be proved by further confirmatory studies before being used in decisionmaking.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
19 Although we adjusted for a wide variety of covariates as appropriate for each outcome residual confounders such as physical activity nutritional status and socio-economic status may alter the results.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Regarding our clinical endpoints as with many epidemiologic studies 4 CKD was diagnosed based on a single measurement of serum creatinine and data on albuminuria were not available.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,1
Moreover eGFR was estimated by the CKD-EPI equation which has not been validated in a local population.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Due to limited statistical power we could not separate stroke subtypes in our analyses.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Previously Sung et al. 31 observed different associations between IFG-WHO and hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke among men suggesting that including hemorrhagic stroke may mask the risk of IFG for ischemic stroke.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Yet in our study only 26 cases of stroke were hemorrhagic.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Last due to the nature of observational studies no causality can be determined between prediabetes and clinical outcomes based solely on this study.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
To the best of our knowledge this is the first prospective cohort study reporting the relationship between the MetS and incident CHD alone or diabetes alone or both in a Chinese population using the five modified definitions.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Although the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in China has been rising it is still lower compared with many Western countries.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Therefore the present study introduced a capillary glucose pre-screening for OGTT at baseline so as to find high-risk non-diabetic individuals while the initial participants at first survey were drawn randomly from a population.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
This selection procedure has two advantages: first the yield of abnormal glucose tolerance at OGTT can be maximized in a large population survey; second the follow-up study may be more efficient because more high-risk cases can be included at baseline only at cost of missing a small number of individuals with diabetes or IGT [24].,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Compared with a study in a general adult population in China [25] the present study showed that the individuals based on the NECP criteria had higher prevalence of abdominal obesity (WC ≥102 cm in men ≥88 cm in women) (21.2% versus 7.7%) hypertriglyceridaemia (34.4% versus 24.8%) hypertension (59.2% versus 41.2%) and high fasting glucose at baseline (27.8% versus 12.7%) (data not shown).,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Compared with a general US population [26] the present population also had higher prevalence of hypertension (59.2% versus 34.0%) high fasting glucose (27.8% versus 12.6%) and hypertriglyceridaemia (34.4% versus 30.0%) but low prevalence of abdominal obesity (27.8% versus 38.6%).,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
This may mainly explain why the present study had a higher incidence of CHD compared with other studies [17][18][19].,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
In addition the single ECG-based diagnosis of CHD in a population-based survey may be another cause of the higher incidence.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
In contrast the other studies identified the cases of CHD in a general population mainly based on hospital records other than the single ECG-based diagnosis.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Therefore the study sample in the present study represents a populationbased high-risk segment identified by raised post-prandial glucose rather than a general population.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
However given that the high-risk population raised threshold of the reference group and the odds ratio would be expected to be higher in a general population the major findings from the study are relevant for health promotion in the general population.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
An obvious question raised in this report was why all definitions and the components of the MetS were not predictors of incident CHD in the Chinese population.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
One explanation was that the five definitions of the MetS did not contain the key risk factors of CVD such as age cigarette smoking total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
"These risk factors have been shown to be strongly associated with the development of CHD and total mortality in middle-aged or elderly individuals in previous prospective studies [27,28].",Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Our study also displayed that elevated levels of total cholesterol (≥ 5.7 mmol/l) age and smoking were predictors of incident CHD alone or total incident CHD (data not shown).,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Another explanation was that the present study ascertained non-fatal cases of CHD based on the ECG abnormality other than hospital records used in the other studies.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
In general patients who are diagnosed as CHD or CVD based on hospital records have more signs of the disease than those ascertained by ECG abnormalities.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Among those with CHD diagnosed by hospital records more cases with the MetS at baseline would have been identified which might make the syndrome to be more effective at predicting CVD.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Third explanation was that unlike the present study the other studies which showed the MetS predicted incident CHD or CVD did not excluded cases with incident diabetes from cases with incident CVD or CHD as outcomes.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
The present results uniquely showed that the five definitions of the MetS strongly predicted the development of both CHD and diabetes combined and total incident diabetes.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Finally subject in the reference group who had IGR and did not develop the incident diabetes and CHD may affect the finding.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
If the subjects with IGR were excluded from the reference group the MetS based on the WHO and ACE definitions predicted the risk of CHD despite higher RRs for incident diabetes.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
The findings suggest the MetS defined by any definition is more effective at predicting incident diabetes.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
However further studies are needed to confirm the findings in other populations especially in general populations.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Our previous study has showed that the cut-off points for obesity insulin resistance as a requirement of the MetS and omission of IGT influenced sensitivity of different definitions for predicting incident diabetes [29].,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Although the new IDF definition recommended ethnicity-specific values for central obesity it defined central obesity as a prerequisite for presence of the MetS and IGT was excluded in the definition as well.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
However one of the most controversial aspects of the MetS in Chinese population is without doubt the standard of obesity.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Thus far there has not been a unified cut-off of obesity because of lack of consistent results from varied studies in China.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
"It has been controversial which anthropometric index of obesity is the best predictor of CHD or diabetes in Chinese [30,31].",Wang_2007_2.txt,0
A study in Chinese women displayed WHR or BMI was a better predictor than WC for incident CHD [32].,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Our study also found that a BMI of ≥25 kg/m 2 or a WHR of >0.90 (women: >0.85) other than a WC of ≥90 cm (women: ≥80 cm) was a better predictor of incident diabetes.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Lowering the cut point of WC from 90 to 85 cm in men still did not change the trend (data not shown).,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Compared with IFG (FPG ≥5.6 mmol/l) IGT was a better predictor of incident diabetes alone.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
Clearly central obesity defined as WC ≥90 cm (women: ≥80 cm) as a requirement and exclusion of IGT in the IDF definition mainly led to a lower sensitivity of the definition for predicting future diabetes in the Chinese population especially in men.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
In contrast the updated NCEP definition used a set of clinical criteria that are similar to those of the IDF criteria however central obesity was not deemed a necessity.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
As a result the sensitivity of the updated NCEP definition for total incident diabetes in Chinese men improved greatly (data not shown).,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
A main limitation in this study is lack of HDL-cholesterol values although all other components of the MetS in terms of different definitions were included.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
However triglycerides of at least 1.7 mmol/l or current use of hypolipidaemic drugs were defined as dyslipidemia may minimize the missing cases of the MetS determined by low HDL-cholesterol.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
In addition since HDL-cholesterol is as a component in each of the five definitions and was equally excluded from each definition due to missing data in this study each of definitions would be expected to be given similar weight.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
Thus the comparison for ability of predictive value between definitions would be valid.,Wang_2007_2.txt,0
In summary The MetS defined by the current definitions appears to be more effective at predicting incident diabetes.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
The definitions defined by insulin resistance or central obesity as a requirement do not seem to be useful for predicting incident diabetes in Chinese especially in men.,Wang_2007_2.txt,1
The results of the present study show that prediabetes and diabetes are associated with an increased overall risk of CVD.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Following adjustment for age and sex overall CVD risk was increased by 19% 28% and 20% for prediabetes defined by IFG only HbA1c only and combined criteria respectively.,Kim_2016.txt,1
After further adjustments for other conventional risk factors participants with prediabetes defined by HbA1c only had a 12% increased overall risk of CVD events.,Kim_2016.txt,1
For major IHD events prediabetes defined by either HbA1c only or combined criteria had increased risks of 54% and 28% respectively after adjustment for age and sex.,Kim_2016.txt,1
These results suggest that prediabetes defined by HbA1c seems to be more strongly and independently associated with the overall risk of CVD.,Kim_2016.txt,1
These results are consistent with those of previous studies [22][23][24] showing that HbA1c is more strongly associated with CVD risk than FPG.,Kim_2016.txt,0
"Because previous studies 33,34 suggested that atherosclerosis develops before the onset of clinical diabetes we wanted to know whether non-diabetic dysglycemia could initiate an atherosclerotic process and to determine which criteria would be more useful for early recognition of the risk in clinical practice.",Kim_2016.txt,0
Therefore we compared the three criteria of prediabetes that were already defined (IFG prediabetes by HbA1c and combined criteria) instead of the quartile or quintile categories of HbA1c used in other studies.,Kim_2016.txt,1
"6,[22][23][24][25]",Kim_2016.txt,0
We could not compare prediabetes by post-challenge plasma glucose (IGT) because oral glucose tolerance tests are not usually performed in general health check-ups or in routine clinical practice although post-challenge hyperglycemia has been reported to be a better predictor of CVD. [15][16][17],Kim_2016.txt,1
Therefore adding HbA1c criteria when defining prediabetes could more reasonably detect people at high risk of CVD than the previously used IFG which is based only on the FPG level.,Kim_2016.txt,1
Our results suggest that physicians should try to identify other CVD risk factors and to actively control those factors when prediabetes has been diagnosed especially when it has been diagnosed in accordance with HbA1c criteria.,Kim_2016.txt,0
When people are diagnosed with prediabetes they are usually recommended to start lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Therefore detecting prediabetes with proper criteria may be helpful in reducing the risk of not only diabetes but also CVD as a result of lifestyle improvements.,Kim_2016.txt,1
Recently a 5-year follow-up cohort study 35 showed that both overall level of daily ambulatory activity and change in ambulatory activity over 12 months exhibited a graded inverse association with the risk of CVD in individuals with IGT at baseline.,Kim_2016.txt,0
"However other studies 27,28 did not show an additional role of HbA1c to conventional CVD risk factors for predicting CVD risk in people with prediabetes.",Kim_2016.txt,0
"Although the reasons for these discrepancies are currently unclear different ethnicities of the study participants could be one of the reasons because disparities in HbA1c levels among different ethnicities have been reported 36,37 and the association between non-diabetic HbA1c levels and all-cause and CVD mortality were reported to vary according to race and/or ethnicity.",Kim_2016.txt,0
39,Kim_2016.txt,0
Other possible explanations for these discrepancies include different methodologies such as outcome definitions and/or duration of follow-up.,Kim_2016.txt,0
In the present study the risks for prediabetes defined by HbA1c were higher for the composite endpoints such as overall CVD or major IHD and CVD events.,Kim_2016.txt,1
However the risks for prediabetes defined by HbA1c were not higher than those defined by FPG for individual endpoints such as stroke or mortality.,Kim_2016.txt,1
In the case of mortality its incidence may be too low to reach statistical significance during the relatively short follow-up period.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Among individual endpoints the superiority of HbA1c seems to come primarily from the difference in PCI.,Kim_2016.txt,0
However in addition to cardiovascular death and MI composite endpoints including revascularization and hospitalization with IHD have also been used as major outcomes in several studies.,Kim_2016.txt,0
"39,40",Kim_2016.txt,0
Although the causal relationship between HbA1c and atherosclerosis is unclear and the mechanism by which HbA1c is associated with increased risk for CVD is not simple HbA1c as a precursor of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) could be related to a low degree of inflammation and future atherosclerosis.,Kim_2016.txt,0
"41,42",Kim_2016.txt,0
We did not observe any significant differences in HRs for overall CVD major IHD and major CVD events between men and women.,Kim_2016.txt,0
The HRs for the IHD events seemed to be higher in women than in men but the difference did not reach statistical significance probably because the numbers of events were small.,Kim_2016.txt,0
In general it has been thought that CVD or IHD events occur more often among men than women.,Kim_2016.txt,0
However there have been several reports that women show increased risk for IHD and related mortality.,Kim_2016.txt,0
[43][44][45][46],Kim_2016.txt,0
The present study has several limitations.,Kim_2016.txt,0
First the study participants were not a random sample of the general population.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Therefore the results may not be generalizable to the entire Korean population.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Second we could not exclude participants who developed incident diabetes before CVD events because we only assessed baseline FPG or HbA1c levels.,Kim_2016.txt,0
However most other studies also used only baseline measures of glycemia.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Third the follow-up period may be too short to obtain sufficient outcomes.,Kim_2016.txt,0
This could have led to an underestimation of outcomes although the confounding effects from incident diabetes would be minimized.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Finally including data from out-patient visits may have led to an overestimation of the outcomes.,Kim_2016.txt,0
However any possible underestimation of outcomes because of the short duration of follow-up could be partly balanced through this analysis.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Despite these limitations our results suggest that HbA1c can be used during health screenings to help identify individuals who will need more follow-up for potential CVD development in the future.,Kim_2016.txt,0
In South Korea health screenings are widely practiced and may be more successful in identifying individuals with prediabetes than more traditional physician-patient office visits.,Kim_2016.txt,0
However in other countries there may be cultural or social system differences in seeing a healthcare provider and screening large numbers of the population with HbA1c may not be applicable.,Kim_2016.txt,0
In conclusion the present study showed that prediabetes defined by HbA1c only was associated with increased overall risk of CVD and major IHD events and adding HbA1c in defining prediabetes has a certain role in detecting individuals at high risk of CVD in Korea.,Kim_2016.txt,1
Further long-term follow-up studies should be performed to confirm this association and to determine whether intensive control of risk factors at an early stage can reduce the actual risk of CVD events in individuals with prediabetes identified by HbA1c criteria.,Kim_2016.txt,0
Both diabetes and IGT are well-established risk factors for CVD [1][2][3][4][5] which includes several medical conditions such as stroke and CHD.,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
"The incidence of stroke is much lower (25%-35% of CHD) than that of CHD in the United States and Europe [2,21,22].",Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Therefore in previous studies the observed risk for CVD seemed to be attributed primarily to the risk for CHD.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Here we evaluated separately the risks of IGT for stroke and CHD using a cohort study of a Japanese population.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
The incidence of stroke is higher (1.5-2.5 times more) than that of CHD in Japan [23][24][25]; therefore the risk for stroke was evaluated more precisely in the present study.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
However even in a previous study of Japanese subjects IGT was shown to be a risk factor for CVD but not for stroke [26].,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
In the previous study the follow-up period (5 years) was substantially shorter than ours (mean 116.5 months); and this difference may account for the insignificant result.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
We have clearly shown here that IGT was a significant risk factor for stroke in a community-based Japanese sample.,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
"Increased risk of IGT for future stroke has been shown [16,17].",Oizumi_2008.txt,1
However the study populations used were those with transient ischemic attacks or minor ischemic stroke or those with CHD; and thus these studies indicated that IGT is a risk factor for stroke in some high-risk populations.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Recently in an English population-based male cohort study glucose intolerance defined as 96 to 199 mg/dL of 2-hour plasma glucose after 50-g oral glucose tolerance test was shown to be a risk factor for stroke mortality (HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.16-1.88) [21].,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
In that study [21] however nonfatal stroke events were not monitored; thus the risk for stroke seemed to be evaluated less precisely.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Both fatal and nonfatal stroke events were monitored in the present study.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Although IGT was shown to be a significant risk factor for stroke diabetes was not shown to be a significant risk factor for stroke in the present study.,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
The above-mentioned study similarly showed that diabetes was not a risk factor for stroke mortality (HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.29-4.64) [21].,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
However these results may not be appreciated.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
As is typical of population-based studies the samples were uneven.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
In this case the number of the diabetic subjects was considerably smaller than that with IGT.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
This fact may have decreased the statistical power to assess the risk for diabetes in the present study and may explain the lack of significance in the results.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
We have shown here that IGT is a risk factor for future stroke independent of age sex and the presence of hypertension.,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
Blood pressures were not measured for all the participants and hypertension was defined on the basis of medications.,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
Therefore those who were hypertensive but not on medications were not defined as hypertensive which may discount the significance of the results.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Except for the factors described above there are several other known risk factors for stroke such as smoking atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia [27][28][29][30].,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
A meta-analysis with 32 separate studies showed the overall relative risk of stroke associated with cigarette smoking (relative risk 1.5) [28].,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
In the Framingham Study the following have been shown: the risk of stroke was increased as the number of cigarettes smoked increased and the relative risk of stroke in heavy smokers (greater than 40 cigarettes per day) was twice that of light smokers (fewer than 10 cigarettes per day) [27]; compared with subjects free of the conditions the age-adjusted incidence of stroke was more than trebled in the presence of hypertension and a near 5-fold excess when atrial fibrillation was present [29].,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
A study to examine the relation between the serum total cholesterol level and the risk of death from stroke in 350 977 men showed a positive association between the serum cholesterol level and death from nonhemorrhagic stroke [30].,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Therefore these factors appeared to be the established risk factors for stroke and thus should have been included in this study; however we could not obtain such information under conditions reliable enough for analysis.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Information about smoking habits was obtained from only some of the participants and none of the participants gave information about the presence of atrial fibrillation.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Information related to hyperlipidemia such as serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels was obtained for most participants (n = 2830).,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
However no information about medication for hyperlipidemia was available; and thus precise diagnosis for hyperlipidemia was not possible.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Nevertheless when we added the information about hyperlipidemia (serum cholesterol levels ≥240 mg/dL and/ or triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL) as one of the covariates for the multivariate Cox regression analysis shown in Table 3 IGT was still shown to be a significant risk factor for stroke (1.53 1.03-2.27 P = .036).,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
Therefore although this result may not be accurate it raises the possibility that the risk of IGT for stroke may be independent of hyperlipidemia as well.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Whether IGT is a risk factor for stroke independent of other factors such as hyperlipidemia smoking habits and atrial fibrillation has yet to be proven.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
"Many epidemiologic studies have shown that IGT is a risk factor for CVD whereas IFG is not [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]18,[31][32][33].",Oizumi_2008.txt,1
However whether IGT and/or IFG is a risk factor for stroke has not been well established to date.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
Several studies in which intima-media thickness has been used as a condition related to carotid atherosclerosis which seemed to lead to the development of stroke have shown that IGT was associated with intima-media thickness but IFG was not [34][35][36] although a controversy exists [37].,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
These facts may indicate that IGT is a risk factor for stroke whereas IFG is not.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
We examined here also the risk of IFG for CVD stroke and CHD and found that IFG was not a risk factor for these conditions.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
These results indicate that IFG is not a risk factor for stroke as well as for CVD.,Oizumi_2008.txt,0
In conclusion IGT is an independent risk factor for future stroke in a Japanese population.,Oizumi_2008.txt,1
More and more attention is focused on pre-DM because it has been a huge burden in China where the incidence of pre-DM  has reached 50.1% among adults.,Qiu_2015.txt,1
It has become a point of concern about the effect of pre-DM on macrovascular events and research is urgently needed to strengthen the evidencebased treatment guidelines for Chinese patients with pre-DM.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
However whether IGR alone could increase CVD risk was still uncertain.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
"11,12 A recent systematic review concluded that IGR did not increase or only slightly increased the risk for CVD 8 and a community-based study showed that glycohemoglobin rather than fasting glucose was significantly associated with CVD.",Qiu_2015.txt,0
13,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Another large Korean study reported that the increased risk for myocardial infarction could only be observed in the diabetic glucose level.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
22 Meanwhile other investigators thought that hyperglycemia within nondiabetic glucose range was associated with increased CVD risk.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
"9,12 Therefore we investigated the association between IGR and incident CVD and DM and explored whether IGR alone or coexistent with other syndrome such as hypertension could promote CVD risks significantly as well.",Qiu_2015.txt,0
The current analysis indicates that people with IGR are at a high risk of developing DM.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
When compared with people without abnormal glucose metabolism people with IGR had 3.88 times the risk of DM. However IGR was not associated with elevated CVD with similar risks for CVD in subjects with NGR and IGR (OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.72-1.87).,Qiu_2015.txt,1
Our results lend support to a recent meta-analysis depending on a set of studies which concluded that there was no increase in risk for CVD or at most a modest increase in risk.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
They further explained that the possible reason for a small increase in risk in some countries with a sizeable and growing percentage of adults with pre-DM might be the substantial numbers of adults developing or dying from CVD.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
8 Population-based longitude data on incident CVD among individuals with combined pre-DM and hypertension are few although both elevated blood pressure and DM are wellknown risk factors for CVD morbidity.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
"23,24",Qiu_2015.txt,0
Our study lasting for a decade provides a chance to observe the 10-year cardiovascular outcomes in natural population and enables us to explore the association between IGR alone or combined with other disorders and future CVD or DM risk thus adding to the understanding of pre-DM in the general population.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Our study showed IGR alone did not promote CVD risk but when it occurred in the hypertensive subjects the risk for CVD was increased by 2.41-fold when compared with normotensive nondiabetic participants.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Hypertension as is well established increased CVD risk significantly either alone or concurrent with IGR indicating elevated blood pressure a more important role than IGR in the development of CVD.,Qiu_2015.txt,1
Whether IGR placed an additive independent effect on CVD in patients with hypertension or acted as a causal product of hypertension as a previous research suggested remain unclear.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
25,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Few studies are found involved in the combined effects of blood pressure and blood glucose on CVD risk.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
A previous study conducted in Arizona taking prehypertension and DM into consideration had drawn a similar conclusion that IFG or IGT alone did not promote the risk of developing CVD whereas IFG and IGT in subjects with SBP between 120 and 139 mm Hg (prehypertension) increased the CVD risk for 2.12-and 2.06-fold respectively when compared with NGR in normotensive subjects (blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg). 14 However their study was aimed at individuals aged 45 to 74 years and they did not include people with hypertension into analysis.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Our study was based on a wider range of population aged 18 to 76 years and included normotensive and hypertensive subjects with different glucose categories thus showing a generalization to the general population.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
Literature has documented an increase in microvascular risk with increases in glycemic levels within the nondiabetic range 26 although macrovascular risk was not observed in prediabetic subjects.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
This is probably because microvascular dysfunction is correlated with plasma insulin levels and elevated insulin levels in pre-DM may damage microvascular blood flow and contribute to microvascular diseases.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
However larger vessels may need a longer duration a higher level of insulin and blood glucose or other accompanied lesions to induce the damage.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
26,Qiu_2015.txt,0
In other words when pre-DM converts to overt DM or occurs with other metabolic syndromes such as hypertension in the same individual it will then significantly promote CVD risk.,Qiu_2015.txt,1
Noteworthily when IGR progresses to DM the risk for CVD increases markedly and get even higher when accompanied by hypertension.,Qiu_2015.txt,0

"Most importantly it may provide evidence for further treatment strategies toward pre-DM in China which have further enhanced the significance of our work.""",Qiu_2015.txt,0
However our findings are limited by several facts:,Qiu_2015.txt,0
We did not perform a baseline glycohemoglobin test in every participant and might therefore have missed some diabetic cases detected by HbA1c alone.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
28 However the clinical diagnosis of both pre-DM and DM in the majority of hospital are mainly fasting and 2-hour glucose and HbA1c was more commonly used for the evaluation of the average blood glucose in the most recent 2 to 3 months.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
In addition our sample size was relatively small and our follow-up rate was relatively low because of uncertain factors.,Qiu_2015.txt,0
However we followed the principle of randomization in baseline enrollment to ensure the representativeness of the sample and compared the participants who attended follow-up with those who were lost.,Qiu_2015.txt,0

When the analyses for mortality risk were performed in different age groups mortality risk gradually decreased from younger to older age groups suggesting higher burden of diabetes-related mortality risk in younger subjects than in older subjects.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Increased mortality risk in patients with diabetes has long been a great burden on the health professionals caring for them.,Rhee_2020.txt,0

Recent data report an increased incidence of young-onset diabetes [4].,Rhee_2020.txt,0
In our study increased mortality observed in patients with diabetes decreased gradually from younger to older age groups.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
For example patients with diabetes who were aged ≥90 years at baseline had approximately 1.2-fold increased mortality risk compared with those without diabetes in the same age group.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
In contrast patients with diabetes who are aged 40 years showed 3.04-fold increased mortality compared with those without diabetes in the same age group.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
These results suggest that there may be greater potential gains from more aggressive treatments in younger patients than in older patients with diabetes.,Rhee_2020.txt,0

In another study performed in sample cohorts of Korean NHIS diabetes-related mortality risk was higher in adults with lower BMI relative to those with higher BMI similar to the results of our study [25].,Rhee_2020.txt,0
"Several possible explanations exist for these results: (1) sarcopenia reflected by lower BMI in patients with diabetes is related to increased mortality [26] (2) sarcopenic obesity with reduced muscle mass and high body fat frequently associated with patients with type 2 diabetes is known be associated with increased mortality [27], (3) being underweight might mean having a lower metabolic reserve that could protect against poor prognosis or outcomes and (4) patients with type 2 diabetes incident at a low BMI due to genetic susceptibility have worse prognosis compared with those who developed type 2 diabetes due to the metabolic stress of obesity in whom diabetes could disappear if they lost weight [28,29].",Rhee_2020.txt,1
However the precise mechanism for increased mortality in underweight subjects is not clearly defined.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Our study has limitations.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
First the definition of glycemic abnormality was evaluated only with FBG levels; HbA1c values were not available in the analyses.,Rhee_2020.txt,1
Therefore there could be some inaccuracies regarding allocation of the participants.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Second definitions of the diseases were evaluated only with claim records and not with actual diagnosis.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
However claim data are presumably accurate in most of the diseases.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Third since the cause of death could not be verified due to the inability to link data for cause of death with NHIS data only the all-cause mortality rate was analyzed.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Fourth diagnosis and definition of prediabetes and diabetes could not be made due to the lack of HbA1c data in national examinations.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Fifth at least in this study we could not include the specific data for anti-diabetic medications in the analyses.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
There are possibilities for biases caused by different medication usage.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Despite these limitations this study is meaningful in that the association of diabetes age and comorbid diseases with mortality were analyzed in a large nationwide database.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
In conclusion our study showed that compared with normoglycemic subjects subjects with prediabetes had an increased mortality risk.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
In addition compared with the absence of diabetes the presence of diabetes and comorbid diseases synergistically increased mortality risk.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Furthermore the increased mortality risk was more prominent in the younger age groups than in the older age groups.,Rhee_2020.txt,0
Strict glycemic control and early intervention for comorbid cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases are warranted to attenuate the increased mortality risk in patients with diabetes.,Rhee_2020.txt,0

Similarly Tanne et al. found increased risk for incident stroke at both ends of the fasting glucose range in older participants with stable coronary heart disease in Israel [9].,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0

"Park et al. and The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration also found an interaction by age in the relationship between fasting glucose and incident CVD suggesting a stronger association in younger individuals [3,4].",Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Specifically Park et al. observed a significantly higher CVD risk in under age 55 with low glucose (<70 mg/dL) compared to older women [3].,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,1
Having found no significantly increased risk associated with low fasting glucose our results are not consistent with the prior literature.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Variations in the source population or in analysis including the adjustment for diabetes and diabetes medication use may explain these differences.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Specifically the attenuation of the association in the lower glucose range when we excluded participants taking diabetes medication suggests that the increased risk associated with low fasting glucose may be a result of pharmacological treatment of diabetes consistent with the results of the ACCORD Trial [8] and not a marker of risk in the general population.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Evidence about the role that sex and age play in these relationships is also lacking.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
"Evidence about the health risks of low fasting glucose is sparse but recent studies offer contradictory evidence on the association between HbA1c in the lower range (below 5.0% or 31 mmol/mol) and risk for all-cause mortality [5][6][7]18,19].",Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,1
Selvin et al. not only provide evidence for a difference in shape in the all-cause mortality relationship for HbA1c compared to fasting glucose (J-shaped and more linear respectively) in a non-diabetic population but also strongly suggest that HbA1c is a better indicator of cardiovascular risk [5].,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
"While fasting glucose and HbA1c share a similar clinical purpose the measurements differ in several ways including potentially different determinants for low values [6,20] and different distributional association with risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality [5].",Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
HbA1c is a much more stable indicator of average glucose levels than fasting glucose.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
"As such a single low fasting glucose measurement in an individual may be accompanied over time by greater variation in glucose levels [21,22].",Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
While glucose variability is associated with chronic disease complications including the development of CVD in diabetic populations [23] the evidence is sparse and the association in non-diabetic groups and the general population is mostly unknown [5].,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
The cumulative nature of glucose exposure reflected by HbA1c compared to the immediate indication offered by fasting glucose may help explain the discrepancies between studies investigating these glycemic markers.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Therefore the primary limitation of this study is the inability to determine whether our findings would differ if we had been able to assess HbA1c in addition to fasting glucose.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Unfortunately HbA1c levels were not measured in the WHI cohort so these studies will have to be conducted in other cohorts.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Second as in many other studies fasting glucose was only measured at a single time point so we could not determine glucose variability and whether such variability was associated with incident CVD and mortality.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Third as the WHI consists only of women we could not determine whether these relationships differ by sex.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Fourth the significant heterogeneity for heart failure specifically by age and smoking status may indicate that the association between low fasting glucose and this outcome varies by subgroup.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
The explanation for this heterogeneity is unclear.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
The sensitivity analysis indicates that the relationship may be weaker at older ages suggesting that by using this postmenopausal population we are missing associations that might be significant in a younger population.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
Finally this study shares the limitations common to observational studies such as residual confounding.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
This study has a number of strengths.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
The large number of participants with measured fasting glucose and the large number of events provided an opportunity to assess these associations separately for specific CVD event types and to determine whether these relationships were the same for CVD and for all-cause mortality.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
The WHI also has the benefit of racial diversity which allows us to determine whether these relationships exhibit heterogeneity by race.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
The use of WHI also  allows us to help fill the gap in the literature about these associations specifically in postmenopausal women.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
In the WHI cohort low fasting glucose at baseline was not significantly associated with survival from specific cardiovascular disease events or all-cause mortality except for an inverse association between low fasting glucose and coronary heart disease.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0
While these results do not support the hypothesis that low fasting glucose is associated with increased risk for CVD and mortality heterogeneity by age suggests that further investigation of the relationship with heart failure in younger populations is warranted.,Mongraw-Chaffin_2017.txt,0

Excess shortterm (median follow-up: 5.6 years) risk of mortality associated with hyperglycemia in older age was highest in those with long-standing diabetes.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Our results are in contrast to studies in middle-aged adults that have demonstrated robust associations of prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes with mortality (23)(24)(25)(26).,Tang_2020.txt,0
Evidence for the health risks associated with hyperglycemia in older adults particularly prediabetes is limited.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Most intervention trials in type 2 diabetes populations have excluded older adults (27).,Tang_2020.txt,0
"Observational studies have documented a higher absolute risk of complications in older adults with diabetes (9,(28)(29)(30).",Tang_2020.txt,0
However older adults with diabetes comprise clinically distinct groups: those with long-standing diabetes (i.e. diagnosed in middle age) as well as those with recent-onset diabetes (9).,Tang_2020.txt,1
Our findings suggest that when considering hyperglycemic status in older age only adults with long-standing diabetes have a significantly elevated short-term risk for mortality independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.,Tang_2020.txt,0
"Our results are consistent with findings from the Diabetes and Aging Study and Framingham Heart Study which observed higher risks of complications and mortality among those with longer duration of disease (4,31) and the Swedish National Diabetes Registry which observed excess mortality risk associated with diabetes among those diagnosed at younger but not older ages (14).",Tang_2020.txt,0
"Diabetes duration has previously been associated with higher risk of end-organ complications including retinopathy and kidney disease (32,33) highlighting the cumulative effects of hyperglycemia on microvascular dysfunction that may underlie the excess mortality risk observed among those with long-standing diabetes.",Tang_2020.txt,1

"The risks of adverse effects of glucose-lowering medicationsdparticularly hypoglycemiad and polypharmacy are heightened in older adults (3,35,36).",Tang_2020.txt,0
In this communitybased cohort participants with diagnosed diabetes on average were taking more total medications compared with those with prediabetes or normoglycemia.,Tang_2020.txt,0
The lack of significant elevations in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality risk among older adults with prediabetes supports focusing on lifestyle modification and management of other cardiovascular risk factors for diabetes prevention in this age-group.,Tang_2020.txt,0
This is in contrast to recommendations in middleaged adults for initiation of pharmacologic therapy for diabetes prevention with medications such as metformin (34).,Tang_2020.txt,0
Prior work in the Diabetes Prevention Program supports the efficacy of intensive lifestyle modification consisting of physical activity and weight loss in older adults (37).,Tang_2020.txt,0
Furthermore those with newly diagnosed diabetes based on more sensitive screening definitions did not appear to be at an elevated shortterm mortality risk suggesting that intensive glycemic screening and use of highly sensitive diagnostic criteria particularly for prediabetes may not be efficient in older adults.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Less aggressive treatment including delaying pharmacologic therapy may be appropriate for older patients with prediabetes or newonset diabetes especially those with shorter life expectancies.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Participants with diabetes diagnosed within the past year appeared to be at a higher mortality risk compared with those with undiagnosed diabetes detected at the visit.,Tang_2020.txt,0
There may be several possible explanations for this finding.,Tang_2020.txt,0
"First it is possible that this is a result of ""detection bias""; that is those participants with other health conditions may have been more likely to receive laboratory screening including blood glucose or HbA 1c testing leading to a diagnosis of diabetes.",Tang_2020.txt,0
While speculative another major difference between the undiagnosed and newly diagnosed diabetes groups was that more than one-quarter of those with newly diagnosed diabetes were initiated on a hyperglycemic medication (primarily oral antihyperglycemics).,Tang_2020.txt,0
Whether this pharmacologic intervention is associated with increased mortality in this group is uncertain.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Our study has some limitations.,Tang_2020.txt,0
First the median follow-up of 5.6 years and number of recorded deaths limited our power to evaluate subgroup effects especially for cardiovascular mortality.,Tang_2020.txt,0
However this time frame is clinically relevant for older populations.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Second despite adjustment for rigorously measured risk factors including kidney function there remains the possibility of residual confounding.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Third we did not have information on follow-up HbA 1c or glucose measurements limiting our ability to account for the time-varying nature of glycemic status.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Finally we are unable to account for any medication initiation or changes among participants after their study visit.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Given the small sample size of those with newly diagnosed diabetes we were unable to further stratify and compare those who initiated pharmacologic intervention with those who did not.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Strengths of the study include the large community-based sample of older black and white adults with active follow-up for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.,Tang_2020.txt,0
The availability of measurements for both HbA 1c and fasting blood glucose allowed us to assess the robustness of our findings to different definitions of prediabetes and diabetes status.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Diabetes in older adults is heterogeneous.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Our results suggest that glycemic status alone is not effective at identifying older adults at highest risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.,Tang_2020.txt,0
Diabetes was associated with excess mortality with the risk increasing with longer duration of disease.,Tang_2020.txt,0
However prediabetes was not independently associated with elevated cardiovascular or all-cause mortality over a median ;6-year window.,Tang_2020.txt,1
Our results confirm that diabetes duration is important to consider in the care of older adults with diabetes and support focusing on lifestyle factors and cardiovascular risk management (such as smoking cessation or cholesterol control) to prevent diabetes and reduce mortality in older adults with prediabetes.,Tang_2020.txt,0
"""The metabolic syndrome as traditionally defined consists of two components: disease factors and pre-disease factors [13].",Tsai_2008.txt,1

Furthermore clinical assessment or follow up process addressing a single pre-disease is simple and straightforward.,Tsai_2008.txt,0
If metabolic syndrome were created to alert physicians in instituting early interventions such as lifestyle changes [13] it was inferior to the use of pre-disease approach for two reasons.,Tsai_2008.txt,1
First clinical identification of metabolic syndrome is cumbersome and nearly impractical in focusing the attention of the patients particularly in monitoring their progress.,Tsai_2008.txt,0
Secondly metabolic syndrome was not as inclusive as the four pre-diseases because in this study prevalence of the pre-disease risk factors (40.2%) was nearly four times larger than the metabolic syndrome (10.6%).,Tsai_2008.txt,1
Three quarters of those with significantly increased CVD risks would have been missed by applying the metabolic syndrome criteria.,Tsai_2008.txt,0
That each of the four pre-diseases has shown independent risks and not necessarily requiring a combination with pre-diseases or even with diseases has both practical and philosophical advantages over the metabolic syndrome being criticized as being polluted with frank diseases.,Tsai_2008.txt,1

Pre-hypertension was defined by The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) as those with systolic blood pressure at 120-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure at 80-89 mmHg requiring health-promoting lifestyle modifications for the prevention of CVD [31].,Tsai_2008.txt,1

Because most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus die of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and not of microvascular complications cardiovascular mortality and morbidity should be considered in defining the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.,DECODE_2001.txt,1
Herein we report on cardiovascular deaths as well as all-cause deaths in the DECODE Study population.,DECODE_2001.txt,0
This study provides evidence that the metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in Korea.,Khang_2010.txt,0
Men and women with the metabolic syndrome had 48% 39% 64% and 127% greater risks of cardiovascular disease stroke ischaemic heart disease and diabetes respectively than those without the metabolic syndrome.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The increased risks of cardiovascular disease ischaemic heart disease and diabetes remained significant after adjusting for a wide range of covariates including major health behaviours (cigarette smoking alcohol consumption and physical exercise) bio-clinical factors (LDL cholesterol and resting heart rate) related family history (hypertension/stroke ischaemic heart disease/heart failure and Note.,Khang_2010.txt,0

The magnitude of association between the metabolic syndrome and health outcomes may vary with study design (e.g. definition of the metabolic syndrome duration of follow-up level of follow-up loss and covariates adjusted) study subjects (e.g. race gender prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and pre-morbid conditions) and health outcomes [2][3][4][5][6][7].,Khang_2010.txt,0
This study showed that the magnitude of the RR and PAR differed by gender and health outcome.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The gender differences in the RR and PAR were more evident for ischaemic heart disease than stroke and diabetes.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The PARs for stroke and diabetes were relatively similar in men and women (see Table 1).,Khang_2010.txt,0
"Prior meta-analyses have shown greater RR of cardiovascular disease and stroke in women than men [3,4,6,7].",Khang_2010.txt,0
The Hisayama study showed that the RR of ischaemic heart disease was greater in men than in women but vice versa for stroke [10].,Khang_2010.txt,0
However in a Hong Kong study the metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with vascular mortality in men not in women [9].,Khang_2010.txt,1
Meanwhile results of our study showed that the RR for incident diabetes was greater than the RR for cardiovascular disease.,Khang_2010.txt,0
"This finding is congruent with previous studies that the metabolic syndrome in many populations predicts incident diabetes more strongly than it predicts cardiovascular disease [2,5].",Khang_2010.txt,0
The analysis according to the number of metabolic syndrome components showed that there was no apparent threshold relationship between the metabolic syndrome and health outcomes (see Fig. 1).,Khang_2010.txt,0
"Several Asian studies have shown linear relationships between metabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease (stroke and ischaemic heart disease) [9,10,[12][13][14][15]22].",Khang_2010.txt,0
The RR increase by the number of components was especially significant for diabetes.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The RR of incident diabetes for those with five abnormal components of the metabolic syndrome was 8.13 (95% CI: 2.43-27.15).,Khang_2010.txt,0
However the risks of diabetes according to the number of abnormal metabolic risk factors have rarely been reported in Asia [22].,Khang_2010.txt,0
This study showed that high blood pressure was an important determinant of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.,Khang_2010.txt,0
After simultaneous adjustment of five metabolic syndrome components high blood pressure was significantly associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease stroke ischaemic heart disease and diabetes.,Khang_2010.txt,1
According to the PARs high blood pressure also explained a substantial proportion of the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (about a third) and diabetes (about a fourth).,Khang_2010.txt,1
Many,Khang_2010.txt,0
Asian studies revealed a more important role for high blood pressure than other components in determining future cardiovascular events [12][13][14].,Khang_2010.txt,0
"Prior Chinese and Japanese studies have shown that elevated blood pressure was the only significant predictor of cardiovascular events [12,13].",Khang_2010.txt,1
Our study also indicated that hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia explained a fourth of ischaemic heart disease and a third of diabetes respectively.,Khang_2010.txt,0
According to a recent meta-analysis the strongest predictor of diabetes was the impaired fasting glucose [5].,Khang_2010.txt,1
It should be noted that in our study the significant RR of incident diabetes-associated hyperglycemia came from the study sample without baseline diabetes after excluding known diabetes patients and subjects with fasting blood glucose of ≥126 mg/dl at the baseline survey.,Khang_2010.txt,0
This study presented the statistically significant gender difference in the relationship between high blood pressure and stroke.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The magnitude of the relationship was greater in women than in men.,Khang_2010.txt,0
In a prior Japanese study the relationship of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with stroke among ages 65-79 was greater in women than in men [23].,Khang_2010.txt,0
It has been suggested that gender difference in arterial structure and function may lead to gender difference in the relationship of risk factors with stroke [24].,Khang_2010.txt,0
Considering the potential gender difference in the profiles of risk factors in predicting stroke incidence [25] more studies on the gender difference would be helpful in better understanding stroke and other cardiovascular diseases.,Khang_2010.txt,0
This study has limitations.,Khang_2010.txt,0
First outcome ascertainment was not done by active surveillance of the study subjects during the followup periods but based on the electronic data linkage to secondary data (death certificate and hospitalisation data).,Khang_2010.txt,0
Although the completeness of these secondary data can reach 100% the accuracy of diagnosis of a disease may be suboptimal.,Khang_2010.txt,0
According to our analysis 81.7% of total cardiovascular deaths (58 of 71) and 4 (100%) of 4 diabetes had been admitted to hospitals because of the same disease.,Khang_2010.txt,0
"Prior Korean studies showed that diagnostic accuracy of hospitalisation data was 83.0% for stroke and 85.6% for ischaemic heart disease [26,27].",Khang_2010.txt,0
Some diabetes patients might have only sought primary health care during the follow-up period without using any hospital inpatient care.,Khang_2010.txt,0
However information on the diagnostic accuracy of diabetes in hospitalisation data as well as the proportion of diabetes patients only seeking primary health services without hospital cares during the 6 years was not available.,Khang_2010.txt,0
These less optimal levels of outcome ascertainment especially for diabetes might have resulted in reduced (rather than enhanced) magnitude of the RR and PAR between the metabolic syndrome and health outcome because baseline metabolic syndrome status may not be related to accuracy of diagnosis in hospitalisation data and death certificate data.,Khang_2010.txt,0
Nevertheless analysis results showed that the relationship between metabolic syndrome and diabetes was stronger than those for ischaemic heart disease and stroke.,Khang_2010.txt,0
Second the duration of follow-up was relatively short and the number of deaths was relatively small.,Khang_2010.txt,0
This hindered further subgroup analyses (e.g. analysis by age groups and stroke subtype) and may have resulted in wide 95% CIs for RRs and PARs.,Khang_2010.txt,0
"However there are mixed findings on the magnitude of association by duration of follow-up [4,7].",Khang_2010.txt,0
This study also has strengths.,Khang_2010.txt,0
First we used the longitudinal follow-up data of a nationally representative sample with information about waist circumference.,Khang_2010.txt,0
Although the response rates of the K-NHANES were not 100% and some of samples (i.e. those with invalid personal identification numbers or missing data pregnant women those with stroke ischaemic heart disease diabetes or cancer at baseline) were excluded our study subjects include Korean men and women with various socio-demographic characteristics all over the country.,Khang_2010.txt,0
"Three prior longitudinal studies employed a nationally representative sample [12,17,18] but two studies from Japan and the US substituted body mass index as a measure for obesity [12,17] and a Turkish study examined the longitudinal relationship in a relatively short follow-up period (3-year follow-up) [18].",Khang_2010.txt,0
Second we presented analysis results on stroke ischaemic heart disease and diabetes.,Khang_2010.txt,0
To our knowledge no Asian studies have presented results on cardiovascular events and diabetes simultaneously.,Khang_2010.txt,0
In summary the metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with cardiovascular disease ischaemic heart disease and diabetes after adjustment of a wide range of covariates in a national longitudinal study.,Khang_2010.txt,1
The RR and PAR for ischaemic heart disease were greater in men than women.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The RR and PAR were greater for diabetes than stroke and ischaemic heart disease.,Khang_2010.txt,0
The number of metabolic syndrome components was linearly associated with risks of all four health outcomes.,Khang_2010.txt,0
Of the abnormal metabolic risk factors high blood pressure was significantly associated with all four outcomes examined in this study while hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia were also important for ischaemic heart disease and diabetes respectively.,Khang_2010.txt,1
Our findings suggest that reduction of metabolic risk factors is necessary in Korea to lower the burden of associated diseases especially ever-increasing ischaemic heart disease and diabetes [28].,Khang_2010.txt,0
The goal of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that IFG is an independent risk factor for CV events in a population-based sample of adults free of CVD at baseline.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
After 7.5 years of follow-up of the largest multi-ethnic cohort so far studied on this subject we observed that: 1) the threshold of fasting blood glucose that is independently associated with CV risk may be in the DM range; 2) IFG is an independent risk factor for future T2DM; and 3) IFG is not an independent CV risk factor.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Since T2DM is an independent CV risk factor aggressive lifestyle modifications that reduce the incidence of T2DM in persons with IFG may have significant impact on CV events rates in this population.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
1. Even though current theory supports the association between IFG and incident CV events the data are mixed (5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15).,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Coutinho et al. (10) showed in a meta-analysis of 20 studies that the progressive relationship between glucose levels and CV risk extends below the diabetic threshold.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Kim et al. (9) showed in a cross-sectional study that IFG may not be associated with increased CV risk in community-based subjects.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Tominaga et al. (12) used a Japanese population to show that impaired glucose tolerance was a risk factor for CVD but IFG was not a risk factor for CVD.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Pankow et al. (11) showed in the ARIC study that in addition to the poor agreement between IFG and post-challenge glucose levels neither fasting glucose nor impaired glucose tolerance was associated with adverse CV risk profile.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Kanaya et al. (7) also showed that IFG is not independently associated with increased risk of CV events in post-menopausal women with coronary artery disease.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
However Levitzky et al. (8) used the Framingham Offspring Study participants to show that IFG may be an independent CV risk factor in women but not in men.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Sawar et al. (13) added a systematic review of Western cohorts to the Reykjavik prospective study to show a modest CV risk among Caucasians with IFG.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The findings of this study (13) were also limited by the incomplete adjustment for confounders in these studies and the use of ICD-9 codes in the ascertainment of outcomes.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Ford et al. ( 14) also showed a modest increase CV risk in their meta-analyses on the association of IFG and CV outcomes.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
However those researchers admitted in their conclusions that depending on the set of studies included in their meta-analysis their findings could be interpreted as no increase or at most a very modest increase in CV risk (14).,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The present study adds to the data suggesting that while IFG is a risk factor for T2DM and DM is an independent CV risk factor IFG per se is not an independent CV risk factor at least during a relatively short time-frame.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The concept of IFG defined as fasting blood glucose between 110 and 125 mg/dl was recommended by the American Diabetes Association Expert Committee in 1997 as a risk category for further screening using a more definitive test such as a 2-h post-challenge glucose test in subjects at risk of developing T2DM (19).,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Data from population studies suggested that a fasting blood glucose range of 94 to 103 mg/dl predicted persons in whom T2DM would develop (20).,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
On the basis of these population-based studies and in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of IFG as a screening tool the fasting glucose criterion was lowered in 2003 by the American Diabetes Association to 100 to 125 mg/dl.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
The implication of the lowering of the fasting glucose criterion was an almost quadrupling of the number of Americans with IFG from 12 million to 44 million (1).,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
The present study found IFG as an independent risk factor for the development of T2DM supporting the notion that interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of IFG would ultimately result in a reduction in the incidence of T2DM in the population.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Diabetes mellitus is considered a coronary heart disease equivalent (11) and persons with IFG (pre-diabetes) have an increased risk of T2DM developing.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
Supported by a meta-regression analysis (10) IFG was postulated to be an independent CV risk factor and this has been adopted by the American Diabetes Association.,Yeboah_2011.txt,1
In the present study the significant association of IFG and CV events in our univariate model was explained by traditional CV risk factors suggesting that the proposed increased CV risk may be due to the coexistence of traditional CV risk factors in persons with IFG.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The subset of IFG subjects in whom T2DM developed during the follow-up period had similar risk for CV events compared with subjects with IFG who did not have T2DM during the follow-up period.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The subjects with IFG in whom T2DM developed during follow-up were younger more likely to be female and obese.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Thus DM was more likely to develop in young obese females with IFG in this cohort and they would therefore be at relatively high risk of future CV events.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
This finding needs replication in other cohorts but has major public health implications with regard to target blood pressure and lipid goals and cost and allocation of resources for the prevention and treatment of CV diseases.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
More studies aimed at identifying the subset of subjects with IFG in whom T2DM would develop and who are therefore at risk of CV events are needed.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Study limitations.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The follow-up period was only 7.5 years.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
We considered defining IFG and DM using a time-dependent variable approach (updating the status at each examination); however we had insufficient incident CV events/limited follow-up time post-transition to produce meaningful results.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Therefore we caution readers to interpret the results of this study within the context of the duration of follow-up.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
It is unclear but possible that given the strong association between IFG and incident T2DM a longer duration of follow-up may reveal a positive association between IFG and CVD events.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The sample size of the subjects with IFG was modest.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Our investigation of incident CV in the IFG subgroup was limited by the relatively short follow-up time for incident CV after conversion to T2DM.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
The participants with T2DM had DM for a variable period before enrollment in the MESA study; thus a comparison of the risk of CV in this group versus IFG or new T2DM is perhaps not a fair comparison to make.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Our study is observational and although we adjusted for the known confounders in our models results may still be affected by residual confounding.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
Finally we used a population-based cohort free of clinical CVD at baseline and our findings do not apply to populations with clinical CVD who are at risk for recurrent CVD.],Yeboah_2011.txt,0
[After 7.5 years of follow-up simply having IFG was not associated with an increased risk for incident CV events.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
More studies aimed at identifying persons with IFG in whom T2DM would develop and who are therefore at increased risk of CV events are needed.,Yeboah_2011.txt,0
In a late middle-aged white Scottish population in 1988/9 the total prevalence of diabetes was 9.2% of which the majority was undiagnosed (66% by ADA criteria and 71% by WHO 1999 criteria).,Wild_2005.txt,1
A large proportion of previously unidentified diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of an elevated fasting glucose level and only 19% was associated with isolated postchallenge hyperglycaemia.,Wild_2005.txt,1
New diabetes diagnosed by any criteria was associated with increased all-cause mortality compared with people without diabetes at baseline and the excess risk was similar to that of people with known diabetes.,Wild_2005.txt,1
A statistically significant excess of cardiovascular mortality was found among people with known diabetes and people with new diabetes defined by either ADA or WHO criteria but not among people with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia.,Wild_2005.txt,1
Isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia was associated with significantly increased risk of non-cardiovascular disease mortality.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Possible explanations for these findings are discussed below and include the limited power of the study.,Wild_2005.txt,0
If these findings are confirmed it would suggest that a post-challenge glucose measurement in people with normal fasting glucose values may not usefully contribute in identifying people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in this population.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The proportion of undiagnosed diabetes in the Edinburgh Artery Study is higher than in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (approximately 35%) [15] and in several other studies e.g. Bedford 1962 [16],Wild_2005.txt,1
Manchester 2000 [17] AusDiab [18] and southern Germany [19] (approximately 50%) but is similar to that observed in Europeans in the 1990 Coventry study of 65% [20] and in a recent population study in Denmark of 66% [21].,Wild_2005.txt,0
One explanation for higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes would be selection bias.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The primary aim of the Edinburgh Artery Study was to investigate the epidemiology of peripheral artery disease and it is possible that individuals at higher risk of diabetes chose to take part in the study.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The proportion of people with new diabetes diagnosed by isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia also differs between populations e.g. prevalence of isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia among people with previously undiagnosed diabetes was 72% among women and 48% among men in the Rancho Bernardo study (aged 50-89 years) [6] 54% in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (of men and women aged 70 -74 years) [15] 52% in the Cardiovascular Health Study (participants aged 65-100 years [7] 36% in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (of men and women aged 45-54 years) [15] 32% in DECODE (6140 Europeans aged 60 -79 years) [5] and 23% of Parisian policemen aged 45-54 years [9].,Wild_2005.txt,0
Possible explanations for these differences include the distribution by sex age ethnicity and body mass index of the populations studied.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Women are more likely to have isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia than men because women tend to have lower fasting glucose levels than men [22].,Wild_2005.txt,1
Elderly and less obese subjects are more likely to have normal fasting glucose levels but 2-h postchallenge glucose levels that are diagnostic for diabetes than younger populations and overweight subjects [4].,Wild_2005.txt,0
The effects of age and sex on proportion of new diabetes associated with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia were not statistically significant in the Edinburgh Artery study population but consistent with other findings people with newly diagnosed diabetes who were not overweight were significantly more likely to have isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia than people who were overweight.,Wild_2005.txt,0
In the Rancho Bernardo Study the risk of cardiovascular mortality was increased in women with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia [age adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.6 and 95% confidence intervals (1.5 -4.8)] but not in men [HR 0.7 (0.3 -1.6)] [6].,Wild_2005.txt,1
The point estimates for Edinburgh Artery Study participants were similar with odds ratios for cardiovascular mortality of 2.7 (0.6 -11.6) for women and 0.8 (0.09 -6.7) for men.,Wild_2005.txt,0
It is possible that the Edinburgh Artery study lacked the power to demonstrate an excess risk of cardiovascular disease mortality among women with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia.,Wild_2005.txt,0
All-cause mortality data among people with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia were not presented for the Rancho Bernardo study.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease stroke and cardiovascular death) among people with newly diagnosed diabetes diagnosed using either the ADA criterion or the WHO 1985 criteria were compared with a reference group that excluded people with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (i.e. fasting glucose levels < 6.1 mmol / l and 2-h glucose levels < 7.8 mmol / l) in the Cardiovascular Health Study [7].,Wild_2005.txt,1
The authors concluded that ADA criteria are less predictive than WHO criteria for cardiovascular disease in the elderly.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The relative risk (95% confidence intervals) of cardiovascular disease among the isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia group compared with the reference group in this study was 1.35 (0.93 -1.96) after adjustment for sex age and ethnic group.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The comparable estimate for the Edinburgh Artery Study (i.e. odds ratio for isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia for combined cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity compared with a group without diabetes impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance adjusted for age and sex) was 0.99 (0.38-2.57).,Wild_2005.txt,0
Shaw et al . reported significantly increased risks of cardiovascular disease mortality after adjusting for age ethnicity smoking blood pressure and BMI for both men (hazard ratio 2.3 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and women (hazard ratio 2.6 95% CI 1.3 -5.1) associated with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia in a combined analysis of data from longitudinal studies in Mauritius Fiji and Nauru [8].,Wild_2005.txt,1
An increased risk of cancer mortality associated with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia that was significant only for men did not appear to be due to weight loss as it persisted after adjusting for BMI and after excluding deaths in the first 2 years of follow-up.,Wild_2005.txt,0
In the Paris Prospective Study men with isolated postchallenge hyperglycaemia were found to have a lower cardiovascular risk profile than those with diabetes diagnosed by fasting hyperglycaemia [9].,Wild_2005.txt,0
After 20 years of follow-up cancer mortality rates were higher in men with diabetes diagnosed by isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia than in men with diabetes diagnosed by fasting hyperglycaemia (31 vs. 17% P = 0.01) similar to the data from Edinburgh Artery participants (26 vs. 18% P = 0.5).,Wild_2005.txt,0
Other similar findings between the studies for comparison between the isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia group and the elevated fasting plasma glucose group were a non-significant excess of all cause-mortality (55 vs. 44% P = 0.1 in the Paris study 63 vs. 51% P = 0.3 in the Edinburgh study) and a non-significant reduction of coronary heart disease mortality (5.8 vs. 11.1%,Wild_2005.txt,0
P = 0.3 in the Paris Study 16 vs. 28% P = 0.3 for cardiovascular death in the Edinburgh study).,Wild_2005.txt,0
In the Paris study a high alcohol intake and significantly higher mortality in alcohol-related causes of death among the isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia group was believed to account for these findings.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The authors concluded that screening for isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia to reduce cardiovascular risk would not be beneficial if people with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia die principally because of cancer.,Wild_2005.txt,0
A further potential explanation for differences in effect of isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia on risk of cardiovascular disease between populations that warrants further investigation is variation in prevalence of features of the metabolic syndrome.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Hyperglycaemia is only one component of the metabolic syndrome and it is possible that the relationship between hyperglycaemia and other features of the syndrome differ between populations.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Waist measurements were not recorded for Edinburgh,Wild_2005.txt,0
Artery study participants but prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (as defined by 3 or more of fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1 mmol / l triglyceride > 1.7 mmol / l HDL < 1 mmol / l systolic BP > 130 mmHg BMI > 30 kg / m 2 ) was higher among people with fasting hyperglycaemia (regardless of post-challenge level) than among people with isolated postchallenge hyperglycaemia 71 vs. 47% P = 0.05.,Wild_2005.txt,1
It is possible that this difference may contribute to the apparent discrepancy in cardiovascular risk between the two groups in this population.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was similar in both men and women (25%) although the distribution of prevalence of metabolic syndrome across the glucose tolerance categories differed by sex ranging from 12.5% in men with normal glucose tolerance and 22% in men with isolated postchallenge hyperglycaemia to 70% in women with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia and 100% in women with combined fasting and post-challenge hyperglycaemia,Wild_2005.txt,1
The major strengths of this study are the prospective population-based cohort design and the use of standard measures of exposure and outcome.,Wild_2005.txt,0
To our knowledge it is the first attempt to investigate the relationship between isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia and mortality in a UK population.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Limitations of the study include the fact that the hypotheses tested were not the primary research questions of the study the small number of outcomes in the isolated postchallenge hyperglycaemia group and the single measurement of glucose tolerance.,Wild_2005.txt,0
In summary WHO 1999 and ADA criteria for newly diagnosed diabetes were associated with similar levels of excess mortality either from all-causes or from cardiovascular disease in the Edinburgh Artery Study population.,Wild_2005.txt,1
There was also a modest excess risk of all-cause mortality associated with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.,Wild_2005.txt,0
People with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia were not at a statistically significant increased risk of cardiovascular disease but were at significantly increased risk of non-cardiovascular disease mortality.,Wild_2005.txt,0
Further research is required to establish the value of screening for isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia in a variety of populations and to investigate the association between isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia and other features of the metabolic syndrome.,Wild_2005.txt,0
The Strong Heart Study is a population-based study of CVD and its risk factors in American Indians.,Lu_2003.txt,0
This population has a high prevalence of diabetes which greatly increases its risk of CVD (27).,Lu_2003.txt,0
Since the baseline examination the cohort has been under continued surveillance and medical records of all participants were reviewed to ascertain CVD events or determine cause of death.,Lu_2003.txt,0
The Strong Heart Study is an ideal population in which to study type 2 diabetes and results obtained in this group are generalizable to the population at large.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Although the Strong Heart Study population is a distinct ethnic group with unique anthropometric and metabolic characteristics diabetes has never been shown to have unique physiology in American Indians and the role of diabetes in CVD is similar across ethnic groups.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Further the current ADA and World Health Organization definitions of diabetes are largely based on data collected in American Indian com-munities.,Lu_2003.txt,1
The fact that these fundamental clinical practice guidelines are based on data from American Indians indicates that these data are generalizable to other populations.,Lu_2003.txt,0

Although participants with ADA-new diabetes by FPG and known diabetes had significantly increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality those with IPH had a small and nonsignificant increase in risk of all-cause or CVD mortality.,Lu_2003.txt,0
"These results are not in agreement with three recent reports from other prospective studies that assessed the consequences of IPH in different cohorts (4,5,19).",Lu_2003.txt,0
The Rancho Bernardo Study followed for 7 years a group of 769 men and 1089 women aged 50 to 89 years who had no history of diabetes or myocardial infarction and no fasting hyperglycemia at baseline (4).,Lu_2003.txt,0
In this study women with IPH had a significantly increased risk of fatal CVD compared with nondiabetic women (hazard ratio [HR] ϭ 2.6) but men with IPH did not have increased risk (HR ϭ 0.7).,Lu_2003.txt,0
The Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE),Lu_2003.txt,0
Study included 11 population-based European studies totaling 4415 men and 2526 women aged 60 to 79 years with followup ranging from 4 to 10 years (5).,Lu_2003.txt,0
Compared with nondiabetic subjects the HR for all-cause mortality was significantly higher in people with IPH (RR ϭ 1.6) and RR was similar to those with fasting hyperglycemia (RR ϭ 1.8) and known diabetes (RR ϭ 1.9).,Lu_2003.txt,0
The Paris Prospective Study involved a cohort of 6881 nondiabetic white men aged 44 to 55 years who were followed for 20 years to describe the characteristics and prognosis of diabetes by FPG IPH and IGT (19).,Lu_2003.txt,0
At follow-up all-cause and cancer death rates were higher in men with IPH than in men with diabetes diagnosed by FPG (55% versus 44% P Ͻ 0.01 and 31% versus 17% P Ͻ 0.01 respectively) but were not significantly different for coronary cause.,Lu_2003.txt,0
The fact that significantly increased CVD cancer or all-cause mortality was not observed in those with IPH in this study may be due to the duration of IPH.,Lu_2003.txt,0
In this population there is a high rate of diabetes and a very rapid conversion from IGT to diabetes and rapid decline in glycemia.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Therefore although CVD risk factors were worse in IPH individuals may not remain in the category of IPH long enough for mortality to increase.,Lu_2003.txt,0
In contrast elderly whites may remain in the IPH category for long periods of time thus allowing the impact of the metabolic changes that accompany IPH to become evident.,Lu_2003.txt,0
In another longitudinal analysis that compared different cohorts from baseline with Strong Heart Study data 140 individuals with IPH of 3356 eligible participants had an approximately seven-fold higher incidence of diabetes (68/140) by ADA criteria than did nondiabetic individuals over an average five-year follow-up.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Those with IFG and IGT had an approximately four-fold higher incidence of diabetes by ADA criteria than did nondiabetic individuals (28).,Lu_2003.txt,1
In this study the baseline prevalence of IPH in American Indians from the Strong Heart Study cohort was 3.6% which accounts for 30.3% among those with newly diagnosed diabetes.,Lu_2003.txt,1
There are conflicting reports from epidemiological studies of IPH prevalence.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Our results for IPH prevalence are consistent with those of NHANES III which reported a 3.27% prevalence of IPH and a 4.73% prevalence of newly diagnosed diabetes in 40-to 74-yearold US adults (6).,Lu_2003.txt,0
Prevalence of IPH in 65-to 80-year-old men and women in the Cardiovascular Health Study was 8.4% in the total cohort and 52% among newly screened diabetic individuals (3).,Lu_2003.txt,1
IPH accounted for 60% of newly screened diabetic men and women aged 50 to 89 years in the Rancho Bernardo Study (4) and IPH accounted for 35% of newly screened diabetic individuals aged 60 to 79 years in the large DECODE study (5).,Lu_2003.txt,1
Of 6881 nondiabetic men aged 44 to 55 years from the Paris Prospective Study 1% had IPH and 33% had diabetes defined by FPG (19).,Lu_2003.txt,1
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in American Indians (25) but risk of cancer mortality was not elevated in those with IPH or diabetes in this study.,Lu_2003.txt,0
A study that in-  cluded 1135 incident cases of diabetes with a follow-up of more than 9800 person-years showed that overall risk of cancer did not differ significantly between the diabetic group and the background population (29).,Lu_2003.txt,0
However in a recent report from the Paris Prospective Study in which cancer death rates were higher in those with IPH than in those with diabetes by FPG the authors concluded that the most likely explanation for the high cancer rates is that men with IPH are heavy consumers of alcohol (49 g of pure alcohol on average per day) (19).,Lu_2003.txt,0
"Another large study reported increased overall risk of cancer among 51,008 subjects with diabetes in a Swedish cohort (30).",Lu_2003.txt,0
More analyses are needed on the effects of hyperglycemia on cancer risk.,Lu_2003.txt,0
At least two issues must be considered.,Lu_2003.txt,0
First the current study is established on the basis that hyperglycemia is associated with increasing CVD risk and all-cause mortality in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17).,Lu_2003.txt,1
A review of 12 prospective studies convincingly indicates that hyperglycemia plays an important role in cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes (11).,Lu_2003.txt,1
"A meta-analysis of 20 studies containing 95,763 nondiabetic participants over 12.4 years demonstrated that the rise in plasma glucose associated with increased cardiovascular risk extends below the diabetic range of glycemia (12).",Lu_2003.txt,0
In the UKPDS however intensive glucose control had limited effect on the prevention of cardiovascular complications (P ϭ 0.052) in type 2 diabetes (31).,Lu_2003.txt,0
Although UKPDS prospective data show a significant effect of hyperglycemia on CVD risk lowering HbA1c by 1% had only a small effect on decreasing microvascular events.,Lu_2003.txt,0
As with UKPDS our data show that CVD risk increases with severity of glycemia.,Lu_2003.txt,0
More intervention strategies with various treatment goals need to be tried before there is a clear picture of the effect of glucose lowering on CVD risk.,Lu_2003.txt,0
The second issue is the limitations imposed by our relatively small cohort in which only 50 of 1744 (2.9%) men and 104 of 2560 (4.1%) women were classified as having IPH.,Lu_2003.txt,0
"Authors of other studies however also have had difficulty in identifying large numbers of people with IPH (4,5,19).",Lu_2003.txt,0
In conclusion the results of our analysis indicate that individuals with IPH have a small but statistically insignificant increase in total or CVD mortality-less than those with diabetes but more than those with IFG (who had no increased CVD risk).,Lu_2003.txt,0
This finding implies that IPH simply represents a stage in the continuum of the deterioration of glucose homeostasis that leads to frank diabetes.,Lu_2003.txt,1
"In populations such as American Indians which have a high prevalence of diabetes this ""downhill"" slope is a rapid phenomenon with early age of onset of diabetes thus effects on CVD are not seen.",Lu_2003.txt,0
In other groups in whom diabetes onset takes longer it is plausible that these conditions with their associated alterations in CVD risk factors are associated with more marked increases in disease rates.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Like those of other studies our results showed that individuals with diabetes even those newly diagnosed on the basis of fasting hyperglycemia had a significantly increased risk of CVD mortality.,Lu_2003.txt,0
Therefore regardless of its prognostic value IPH (and even IGT or IFG) when recognized must receive immediate preventive attention because of its known associated high risk for the development of diabetes.,Lu_2003.txt,1
This study reports for the first time that IGT at baseline was associated with significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older Chinese men at high risk for CVD.,Fang_2019.txt,1
"In addition IGT was associated with significantly increased risk for incident T2DM composite cardiovascular   Increased risk of all-cause mortality in type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been well described in the literature [20,21].",Fang_2019.txt,1
Data from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration study [22] has shown independent associations of diabetes with substantial premature death from vascular disease several cancers infectious diseases and other causes.,Fang_2019.txt,0
However fewer studies have investigated the risk of all-cause mortality and disease-specific mortality in individuals with IGT especially in older adults.,Fang_2019.txt,0
One systematic review and meta-analysis sug-gests an association between IGT and all-cause mortality in a combined but diverse populations [7].,Fang_2019.txt,0
The Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Europe (DECODE) Study has shown that IGT not IFG was predictive for all-cause mortality and deaths from cardiovascular disease [23].,Fang_2019.txt,1
In the Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle Study while IGT was shown to be associated with all-cause mortality it had no association with death from cardiovascular disease [24].,Fang_2019.txt,1
However a previous study in 637 older Finnish men investigated the association of glucose intolerance with death during a 5-year follow-up and found that the relative risk of mortality among diabetic men (RR 2.10 95% CI 1.26-3.49) and among IGT men (RR 1.17 95% CI 0.71-1.94) was greater than compared to NGT men.,Fang_2019.txt,0
This study demonstrated a significantly increased risk of death among older men with T2DM but a non-statistically significant increased risk among older men with IGT [25].,Fang_2019.txt,0
Our study also focused on older men but the difference between the 5 year Finnish study and our 11 year study may be the length of follow-up.,Fang_2019.txt,0
T2DM had a much greater impact on participants compared to IGT which may take longer to observe changes in outcomes.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Furthermore the duration of IGT may also be important given the well-established relationship between the duration of T2DM and mortality [26].,Fang_2019.txt,1
The Whitehall II study enrolled 5427 nondiabetic participants aged 50-79 years with a median of 11.5 years of follow-up and suggested that prediabetes defined by FPG or 2hPG was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality [27].,Fang_2019.txt,1
Similar to this study our research had a participant follow-up of 11.2 years.,Fang_2019.txt,0
The difference between the Whitehall II study and our study may be attributed to the age of participants.,Fang_2019.txt,0
We found that the risk of mortality in older men aged ≥75 years was significantly higher than that in older men aged <75 years.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Other inconsistencies between the results of these studies may be attributed to a number of variables including different diagnostic criteria and whether or not major risk factors were adjusted for.,Fang_2019.txt,0
In addition the average age of the participants at baseline was over 70 years old in the present study.,Fang_2019.txt,0
This may have contributed to an effect on mortality in IGT subjects due to the increasing incidence with age of cardiovascular events cancer etc.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Importantly the participants in this study were at high risk for CVD due to a high prevalence of previous coronary heart disease hypertension and dyslipidemia at baseline which may be another factor contributing to the difference between groups.,Fang_2019.txt,0
A recent study showed that IGT was associated with increased risk of mortality but much of this increased risk was attributable to the development of T2DM [28].,Fang_2019.txt,1
Because the participants in this study were all IGT subjects the development of T2DM during follow-up should play a significant role in mortality.,Fang_2019.txt,0
However our study focused on the different associated risk factors between IGT and NGT subjects.,Fang_2019.txt,0
When logistic regression analysis was performed we found that IGT but not incident T2DM was associated with increased all-cause mortality compared with NGT.,Fang_2019.txt,0
During follow-up development of T2DM occurred in both IGT and NGT groups.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Nevertheless in the IGT group insulin resistance baseline glucose abnormalities and a higher incidence of diabetes during follow-up increased the likelihood of cardiovascular events.,Fang_2019.txt,0
This finding from our work suggests a strong correlation between IGT and mortality.,Fang_2019.txt,0
In addition we also found that baseline age was the most important factor associated with death except for composite cardiovascular outcome and incidence of cancer during follow-up.,Fang_2019.txt,0
"An increased risk of composite cardiovascular outcome observed in participants with IGT in the present study is consistent with findings reported by previous studies [23,29].",Fang_2019.txt,0
Endothelial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress have been described in individuals with IGT [30] and is suggested to predict the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease [31].,Fang_2019.txt,1
Other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia are closely associated with IGT and taken together may also contribute to cardiovascular damage.,Fang_2019.txt,0
In the present study we report IGT as an independent predictor of nonfatal stroke and heart failure.,Fang_2019.txt,0
"This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a significant association between prediabetes and an increased future risk of stroke [32,33].",Fang_2019.txt,0
We did not observe increased events of coronary heart disease i.e. nonfatal myocardial infarction or unstable angina in this study.,Fang_2019.txt,0
This is likely due to the requirement of PPG ≥ 7.2 mmol/L for all participants prior to administration of OGTT.,Fang_2019.txt,0
This stringent criterion may have led to missing participants with NGT attenuating the difference between IGT group and NGT group.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Alternatively clustering of hypertension dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia rather than hyperglycemia alone may significantly influence such cardiovascular events.,Fang_2019.txt,0
The primary difficulty encountered during this study is subject follow-up.,Fang_2019.txt,0
The mean follow-up time in the present study was 11.2 years.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Participants showed good compliance with just fifteen (3.3%) participants lost to follow-up.,Fang_2019.txt,0
The remaining participants were followed throughout the study until death or the completion of the trial and received at least one visit per year to perform physical examination and laboratory tests.,Fang_2019.txt,0
The major strengths of this study include the longitudinal nature of the study with a follow-up period of over 11 years and minimal lost to follow-up of study participants.,Fang_2019.txt,0
In addition all clinical diagnoses and events during follow-up were closely monitored and confirmed.,Fang_2019.txt,0
We also carefully adjusted a number of potential confounding factors in our analyses.,Fang_2019.txt,0
However this study also has several limitations.,Fang_2019.txt,0
For example a participant PPG ≥ 7.2 mmol/L measured by glucometer was required prior to performing OGTT.,Fang_2019.txt,0
This requirement may be biased towards IGT detection and ultimately attenuate the differences between the IGT and NGT study groups.,Fang_2019.txt,0
Other limitations include the reliance on a single OGTT to discern glucose metabolism at baseline and a limited number of 2 h plasma glucose measurements during follow-up.,Fang_2019.txt,0
In addition the possibility of other confounding factors cannot be completely eliminated due to the observational nature of this study.,Fang_2019.txt,0
This study in Tayside Scotland UK shows that a diagnosis of IGR or prediabetes in a patient is associated with an increased risk of mortality when compared with individuals who have had a blood glucose test but who are found to be normoglycemic.,Evans_2015.txt,1
This excess risk decreases as age increases and is absent among people aged over 85 years.,Evans_2015.txt,0
This probably explains some of the conflicting evidence found on this association thus far.,Evans_2015.txt,0
Several studies that have identified no increased risk have been restricted to older people.,Evans_2015.txt,0
5 6 In this study the increased risk evident for cardiovascular mortality is lower than for all-cause mortality and no such increased risk is evident for people older than 65 years.,Evans_2015.txt,0
It is important to note that the comparator population of normoglycemic individuals in this study is not a healthy control group.,Evans_2015.txt,0
They are people who have had a blood glucose test as part of their clinical care for whatever reason (blood glucose tests are not carried out routinely in the UK) and are likely to be less healthy and more medicalized than the general population.,Evans_2015.txt,0
For this reason the risk ratios are probably all slightly underestimated.,Evans_2015.txt,0
We have no information on possible lifestyle-related confounding factors such as smoking or body mass index that are associated with increased mortality and may be unequally distributed between the IGR and the non-IGR cohort.,Evans_2015.txt,0
Although adjustment for SIMD may account for some of these differences (as adverse lifestyle factors are often patterned by SIMD) it is difficult to predict whether adjustment for specific factors would increase or decrease estimates of the HRs.,Evans_2015.txt,0
Despite these limitations we still see clear patterns emerging particularly by age.,Evans_2015.txt,0
Of relevance to clinicians and public health practitioners is that the effects on mortality of IGR status and also deprivation are more pronounced for younger patients (according with a previous study in Tayside that showed that a diagnosis of diabetes over the age of 65 years had a comparatively weak association with mortality 14 ).,Evans_2015.txt,0
The association between IGR and cardiovascular mortality appears to be less strong than that for overall mortality and there is a less pronounced gradient for fasting plasma glucose levels.,Evans_2015.txt,0
This study suggests that patients with IGT are the highest risk group of patients with IGR but that increasing fasting plasma glucose levels among patients with IFG are associated with increasing mortality.,Evans_2015.txt,0
However a limitation to this study is the possibility of misclassification of IGR diagnoses.,Evans_2015.txt,0
Although it was assumed that two blood glucose results recorded on the same day represented a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test this may not have been true for every patient.,Evans_2015.txt,0
It is also possible that some IGT diagnoses were missed because the majority of patients only underwent one test and those who had two may well have been sicker patients.,Evans_2015.txt,0
The WHO criteria allow a single fasting test of 6.0-6.9 mmol/L to diagnose IFG (although IGT cannot then be ruled out).,Evans_2015.txt,1
Misclassification of IGT in the IFG cohort would result in a dilution of differences between the two groups yet we still see higher mortality in the IGT group.,Evans_2015.txt,0
More detailed analysis of the associations between fasting and 2 h plasma glucose tests whether they are independent of each other and how they translate into excess mortality is beyond the scope of this study particularly given the frequency of single fasting tests only.,Evans_2015.txt,0
This large record-linkage study has been carried out using wellvalidated data sets.,Evans_2015.txt,0
The biochemistry database is a secure and complete record of all biochemical investigations for Tayside since 1993 and contains over 25 million data items.,Evans_2015.txt,0
Identification of mortality relied on a national data set of death certification.,Evans_2015.txt,0
We are therefore confident in the robustness of the data and study methods.,Evans_2015.txt,0
The study highlights how important it is to prioritize young people with IGR for prevention not only to reduce their risk of progression to type 2 diabetes 13 but also to reduce their risk of mortality.,Evans_2015.txt,0
Conversely it is less important to be aggressive about risk factor modification in older people with IGR thus limiting the risk of adverse side effects from inappropriate medications.,Evans_2015.txt,0
In the present study the MetS defined by all six current criteria predicted CVD mortality in the elderly population.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Moreover the MetS defined by the WHO ACE and IDF criteria predicted CHD mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,1
None of the MetS definitions predicted all-cause mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,1
The MetS however did not predict CVD mortality beyond and above of four of its single components namely IFG IGT low HDL cholesterol and microalbuminuria.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Of the single components of the The metabolic syndrome predicts cardiovascular mortality MetS IGT and microalbuminuria had the highest HRs for CVD mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Accordingly the WHO and ACE criteria for the MetS which include IGT and microalbuminuria in their definitions predicted most consistently CVD and CHD mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Several prospective studies have evaluated the value of the NCEP and WHO definitions to predict CHD CVD and allcause mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,1
[11][12][13][14][15],Wang_2007.txt,0
However most of these studies have used modified definitions other than those originally proposed.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Moreover these studies have varied with respect to characteristics of baseline population number of deaths and statistical analyses.,Wang_2007.txt,0
The Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study 11 reported that both the NCEP and WHO criteria predicted all-cause CHD and CVD mortality after the adjustment for age examination year low-density lipoprotein cholesterol smoking and family history of CHD in 1209 men aged 42-60 years without initial diabetes and CVD.,Wang_2007.txt,1
However an oral glucose tolerance test was not performed.,Wang_2007.txt,0
In contrast the San Antonio Heart Study 12 including 2372 participants aged 25-64 years without initial diabetes and CVD showed that after the adjustment for age gender and ethnic group neither the modified WHO definition (microalbuminuria excluded) nor the NCEP definition predicted all-cause mortality but the latter was associated with a 2-fold risk of CVD mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,1
The Hoorn study 16 investigated whether the EGIR NCEP WHO (microalbuminuria excluded) and ACE definitions predicted 10-year risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD in 615 men and 749 women without diabetes and self-reported CVD at baseline.,Wang_2007.txt,0
The results showed that the NCEP EGIR and ACE definitions predicted all-cause mortality and only the NCEP definition was predictive of CVD mortality in men whereas among women there was no association of the MetS defined by any definition with mortality from all-cause and CVD.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Clearly the modification of the definition differences in covariates and the number of study subjects and outcomes have resulted in inconsistent findings with respect to the importance of the MetS as a cardiovascular risk factor.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Since one of the main purpose of the working definitions for the MetS has been to establish a useful clinical tool to identify individuals at high risk for CVD it is important to investigate whether the current six definitions for the Met predict CVD morbidity and mortality and compare their ability to predict mortality in one study population as we have done in the present study.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Compared with the previous studies the present study has several advantages.,Wang_2007.txt,0
First to our knowledge this is the first prospective population-based study investigating the relationship between CHD CVD and all-cause mortality and the MetS defined by all the six current criteria and including all components of each definition.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Second our study has a large number of deaths (445 deaths) due to a long follow-up which ensures an adequate power of statistical analyses.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Third as diabetes is a powerful predictor of mortality independently of the MetS an oral glucose tolerance test was used to exclude all diabetic subjects from our study.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Fourth we also investigated the MetS as a predictor of mortality in subjects without CVD at baseline.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Fifth when we studied the MetS as a predictor of CHD CVD and all-cause death mortality rates were adjusted for confounding variables showing a statistically significant association with CVD or CHD mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Finally our study was performed in a population of elderly subjects in whom most events of cardiovascular disease occur.,Wang_2007.txt,0
In the present study we also studied the MetS as a predictor of CHD CVD and all-cause mortality separately in men and women.,Wang_2007.txt,0
The MetS predicted CHD CVD and all-cause mortality only in men not in women.,Wang_2007.txt,0
However mortality rates were significantly lower in women than in men suggesting that the lack of statistical power may explain this gender difference.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Also a previous study based on 11 prospective European cohorts found that the relative risk of CVD and all-cause mortality associated with the MetS was similar in men and women.,Wang_2007.txt,0
14,Wang_2007.txt,0
It has remained unclear whether the MetS predicts CVD mortality better than its single components.,Wang_2007.txt,0
In the present study we found that of the single components of the MetS particularly IGT and microalbuminuria but also IFG and low HDL cholesterol were predictive of CVD mortality.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Accordingly the WHO and ACE criteria for the MetS which include IGT and microalbuminuria in their definitons most consistently predicted CVD and CHD mortality and had the highest HRs in different statistical models.,Wang_2007.txt,1
In contrast when subjects with microalbuminuria or IGT were excluded the predictive power of the MetS was significantly attenuated.,Wang_2007.txt,0
"Our findings support the findings of previous prospective studies including our study 33 which have shown that microalbuminuria predicts CHD and CVD morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality independently of other risk factors 34,35 and that subjects with IGT have markedly higher risk for all-cause and CVD mortality than subjects with IFG. 36",Wang_2007.txt,0
As the MetS did not have higher HRs for CVD mortality than its single components our study suggests that the MetS does not predict CHD and CVD above and beyond its components.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Our findings are in concordance with a recent case-control study showing that the MetS defined by the NCEP and updated NCEP criteria was not associated with a greater risk of early-onset coronary artery disease than individual components of the MetS such as low HDL cholesterol hypertension and IFG. 37 A limitation of our study is the absence of middle-aged individuals in the cohort.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Our study included only elderly subjects which may lead to survival bias.,Wang_2007.txt,0
In addition there was a limited number of CHD and CVD deaths when analyses were done separately for men and women.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Furthermore because of several definitions of the MetS multiple testing increases the likelihood of false positive P-values.,Wang_2007.txt,0
In conclusion the MetS defined by all six current criteria predicts CVD mortality in the elderly.,Wang_2007.txt,1
However four single components of the MetS namely IFG IGT low HDL cholesterol and microalbuminuria predicted CVD mortality with equal or higher HRs when compared with the MetS.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Therefore our study gives support for the notion that the MetS is a marker of CVD risk but not above and beyond the risk associated with its individual components.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Our study demonstrated an excess in mortality from all-causes among those with raised HbA1 C  including within the pre-diabetes range among those with diagnosed diabetes.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Raised HbA1 C among people with diabetes was also strongly associated with mortality from CVD but not cancer.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
BMI and socioeconomic status did not affect the associations.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
These results support those of Skriver et al. who found increased all-cause mortality among those with an HbA1 C measurement 7% (53 mmol/mol) (HR 1.26 (95% CI 1.15 1.39)) and a U-shaped relationship between increasing HbA1 C and all-cause mortality.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
[8] A 2013 study also found an increased HR in relation to HbA1 C and all-cause mortality that was marginally non-significant (HR 1.21 95% CI 0.99-1.47). [5],Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Within the current study among those with diabetes only those with raised HbA1 C had an increased risk of all-cause mortality while for mortality from CVD all diabetes/raised HbA1 C categorieshad an increased risk.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

Fig,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
The results of our current study support those of previous research in finding HbA1 C to be more strongly associated with mortality from all-causes and CVD rather than cancer.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
"[5,10,15]",Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Compared with normoglycaemic participants those with raised HbA1 C and/or diabetes (uncontrolled undiagnosed or with a moderately raised HbA1 C ) had an increased risk of mortality from all-causes and CVD; those with controlled diabetes had an increased risk of CVD mortality only.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,1
Earlier studies found that impaired glucose metabolism impacts upon CVD mortality for women to a greater extent than for men [30]; our results indicate differences in risk by sex dependent upon HbA1 C /diabetes category analysed.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
We found HbA1 C and diabetes were not significantly associated with cancer mortality although an earlier cohort study found a 1mmol/l increment in glucose increased the risk of fatal cancer for both men (1.15 1.07-1.22) and women (1.21 1.11-1.33). [18],Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

Research able to utilise larger datasets with a greater number of cancer mortality is needed to further assess the association between HbA1 C and cancer mortality.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
One reason for the lack of association between HbA1 C and cancer mortality within our results but found in those of earlier studies may be the differing rates of site-specific cancers within the all-cancers outcome variable used within each study.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Although limited in number previous studies have suggested that increased blood glucose is associated with increased mortality from a number of site-specific cancers but is not associated with others.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

Therefore results related to a grouped all-cancers variable may be concealing differences in site-specific cancer mortality risk.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Further research is required which explores the associations between HbA1 C and site-specific cancer mortality and incidence.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
The larger sample size utilised by Stocks et al. [18] and the longer follow-up time and corresponding greater number of cancer deaths in the research undertaken by Joshu et al. [31] compared with our study may also have given these studies the power needed to find a small statistically significant difference.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

A number of plausible pathways have been proposed for the relationship between HbA1 C  diabetes and cause-specific mortality.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

Although the epidemiological evidence related to HbA1 C and cancer is limited the key biological causal factors relate to the anti-apoptotic proliferative and mitogenic nature of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and the impact that hyperglycaemia has upon mortality risk.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
[35][36][37],Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
If a causal association were to be found between raised HbA1 C and mortality from CVD and other causes then some of the differences found in mortality between those with and without diabetes could be overcome through stricter glycaemic control.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
"At the same time the potential deleterious impact of tighter control-for example the increased mortality found within the strict glucose control group of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study and the risk of hypoglycaemia [9,[38][39][40]-would have to be anced against any such reductions in mortality and take into account the specific characteristics of each individual with raised blood glucose.",Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

Although the results of earlier analyses (not shown) were suggestive of ethnicity not having a significant impact upon the excess mortality found among those with raised HbA1 C /diabetes the small number of deaths among those from Black and Minority Ethnic populations and the corresponding lack of power made interpretation of the results difficult.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Studies utilising larger datasets with a corresponding larger number of mortality endpoints could further explore the impact of ethnicity.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
The current study did not assess the impact that the use of different types of diabetes-related medications may have upon the excess risk experienced by those with diabetes.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Those with diabetes may change drug regimens regularly and may switch from oral medications to insulin as their disease progresses.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

Our results demonstrate that diabetes/raised HbA1 C are associated with mortality from CVD and all-causes.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0

The NHANES III cohort study is a large prospective multiethnic nationally representative study with well-characterized data on multiple risk factors and confounders.,Deng_2017.txt,0
Nevertheless there are limitations.,Deng_2017.txt,0
We defined prediabetes and T2DM on the basis of the HgbA1c test.,Deng_2017.txt,1
The advantage of HgbA1c is that it reflects average blood glucose level over the past 3-4 months and exhibits greater specificity and pre-analytic stability than other diagnostic markers such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,Deng_2017.txt,0
However the limitation is that the sensitivity of HgbA1c test is lower than FPG test and OGTT test [2].,Deng_2017.txt,0
"This likely explains why the unweighted percentage of prediabetes and diabetes were only 20 and 7 % respectively which is below the estimated prevalence at the national level based on the 2005-2006 NHANES report [2,4]; though strict exclusion criteria and national trends in the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes probably also contribute to the difference.",Deng_2017.txt,0
The main limitation of this study was that dietary intake was estimated based on single self-reported 24HR which may not reflect the long-term dietary habits and hence can lead to potential misclassification bias.,Deng_2017.txt,0
This would tend to reduce the probability of detecting an effect.,Deng_2017.txt,0
Dietary assessment was available only at one time point and participants dietary habits might have changed during the follow-up period.,Deng_2017.txt,0
However several previous studies reported that dietary pattern classification is moderately stable over time [48][49][50][51].,Deng_2017.txt,0
There are several possible reasons that the associations seen in the prediabetic population were not seen in diabetic patients who also had higher CRP and DII scores.,Deng_2017.txt,0
First of all diabetic patients might be on certain anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin for the prevention of CVD which may have attenuated the inflammatory response to a pro-inflammatory diet.,Deng_2017.txt,0
Secondly diabetic patients might change their dietary pattern as directed by their primary care physician.,Deng_2017.txt,0
"Finally it may be that the direct effects of T2DM on mortality are so great that they overwhelm the impact of dietary inflammation.""",Deng_2017.txt,0
A final limitation is that information was available for only 27 of the 45 food parameters ideally used for DII calculation.,Deng_2017.txt,0
Thus far we have published more than 40 DII-related manuscripts.,Deng_2017.txt,0
On average we have had data on 27 food parameters.,Deng_2017.txt,0
"In instances where we can compare across methods [30,36] we have not observed any change in the predictive ability of DII when going from ~45 to <30 parameters.",Deng_2017.txt,0
Also in a recent publication in NHANES III DII scores calculated from the same 27 food parameters were found to be associated with mortality [52].,Deng_2017.txt,0
Therefore it appears that these 27 parameters are sufficient for creating a reasonable estimate of the inflammatory effects of diet.,Deng_2017.txt,0
This is possibly due to the fact that some of the missing food parameters (such as turmeric saffron and ginger) are likely consumed in small quantities and hence may not have a much impact on the overall DII.,Deng_2017.txt,0
In conclusion individuals with prediabetes who consumed a more pro-inflammatory diet were at increased risk of dying from all causes from all cancers from digestivetract cancer and from CVD compared to individuals who consumed a more anti-inflammatory diet.,Deng_2017.txt,0
Directions for future research should include an examination of how DII behaves longitudinally in an intervention trial among individuals with prediabetes to see if the reduction of the DII scores over time (i.e. by increasing intake of vegetables and fruits nuts low-fat dairy fish and whole grains) would delay the development and progress of diabetes CVD and cancer.,Deng_2017.txt,0
As mentioned above approximately 35 % of US adults ≥20 years have prediabetes.,Deng_2017.txt,0
Interventions to promote reductions in dietary inflammation have the potential to reduce mortality in this large portion of the population.,Deng_2017.txt,0
Our analysis of a large Chinese cohort with more than 140 000 person-years of follow-up showed that individuals with isolated elevated 2-hour postload glucose had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality by 43% than those with normoglycemia.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
In our study 28% of T2DM and 54% of prediabetes (IFG/IGT) would have been identified without measuring 2-hour postload glucose highlighting its importance.,Jiang_2020.txt,0

T2DM defined by elevated HbA1c was significantly associated with a higher risk of CVD mortality.,Jiang_2020.txt,1
"Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that using fasting glucose only to define T2DM might fail to identify up to one-fifth of the newly diagnosed diabetes (3,19) and hyperglycemia defined by 2-hour postload glucose predicted premature death better than that defined by fasting glucose alone (20)(21)(22)(23).",Jiang_2020.txt,1
Our study showed that individuals with isolated elevated postload glucose had a higher all-cause mortality risk by 43% (95% CI 15-78).,Jiang_2020.txt,0
OGTT is much less frequently used.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Using solely FPG to rule out abnormal glucose tolerance would falsely reassure a large proportion of individuals as having normoglycemia and these individuals are likely to miss the opportunity for preventive interventions.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Note that in our study the comprehensive glycemia measures at baseline were likely to have helped to deliver a warning to those who were diabetic or had prediabetes and changes in lifestyles or antidiabetic medication might have been taken up in this group.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
These may lead to a reduced mortality in these individuals and therefore the risk we observed could well be an underestimation of the true effect of postload hyperglycemia on mortality risk.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
"In earlier reports from the Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE) study one-half of the patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were defined by the 2-hour glucose criteria (24,25).",Jiang_2020.txt,1
In our study 40% of participants with newly diagnosed had elevated postload glucose by 2-hour OGTT and of these participants with postload glucose diabetes 26% had normal fasting glucose.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
We found a slightly higher proportion of individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM who had elevated 2-hour postload glucose than that reported in the DECODE study supporting perhaps a more important role of postload glucose measurement in the diagnosis of diabetes and mortality risk prediction in Chinese patients (2).,Jiang_2020.txt,0
In our study 28% of the participants who had diabetes according to the 2-hour postload glucose criteria were classified as normal according to the fasting glucose criteria.,Jiang_2020.txt,1

Inclusion of the 2-hour postload glucose with the fasting glucose criteria significantly improved the predictions.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Moreover our study found that T2DM was associated with a 30% increased risk of total cancer which was comparable to results from a pooled analysis of 19 prospective cohort studies in the Asia (the HR for cancer mortality from T2DM was 1.26) (26).,Jiang_2020.txt,1
In another previous meta-analysis of studies conducted mainly in the West T2DM was associated with a 21% higher risk for cancer mortality (27).,Jiang_2020.txt,1

The adoption of the HbA 1c as a diagnostic method in community settings needs to be further assessed.,Jiang_2020.txt,0

However there were some limitations.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
First the duration of follow-up may not be sufficient especially for some subgroup analyses (ie subgroups of FPG within participants with normal 2-hour postload glucose levels or groups of HbA 1c ).,Jiang_2020.txt,0
However increased mortality risks with the relatively short follow-up highlight the considerable impact on life from T2DM.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Second only a number of participants had both 2-hour postload glucose and HbA1c measured during the first examination (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008).,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Thus we could not compare the effects of progression in these glycemic measures on death.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Third assessments of glycemic status during the second examination relied on repeated measurements but not all participants returned for the second examination.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Compared with those who participated in the second examination (who must be survivors and healthy enough to come back) nonparticipants tended to be older and have poorer health status at the first examination (15).,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Such a potential selection bias might have influenced the association between glycemic measures and mortality risk and attenuated the results toward the null.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
However we used inverse probability weighting to account for this potential selection bias although the true effect on mortality risk might be clearer with a longer duration of follow-up.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
In conclusion our study showed that 28% of participants with T2DM in our cohort were identified by 2-hour postload glucose alone.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Participants with elevated 2-hour postload glucose levels had a higher risk of mortality than those with elevated fasting glucose or HbA 1c .,Jiang_2020.txt,0
The OGTT remains the most valuable test in diagnosing T2DM.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Relying only on fasting glucose or HbA 1c misses a substantial proportion of people with higher risk of mortality.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
Consideration should be given to the use of OGTT despite being cumbersome in regular health checks in China.,Jiang_2020.txt,0
In addressing sex-specific associations with DM and CVD in a middle-aged and elderly population sample having normal GM and a high prevalence of the MS at baseline this study found by assessing the relative roles of (abdominal) obesity and MS that women are likely to develop abnormal GM followed by CVD whereas men are likely to develop CVD directly after developing MS. A further salient finding was that obesity alone unaccompanied by MS was an independent predictor neither of abnormal GM nor of CVD in either sex and that even in predicting abnormal GM in women the weighting of BMI was less than that of MS. Given the overlapping of the conditions (abdominal) obesity and MS the latter-in the context of subjects with normal GM and when opposed to (abdominal) obesityconnotes mainly dyslipidemia and hypertension.,Onat_2005.txt,0
In agree-ment with this statement is the fact that significant differences in the MS-only group compared with the obese-only group were higher BP measures triglycerides and apo B concentrations TC/HDL-C ratio (but not LDL-C) and lower HDL-C levels in both sexes.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Hypertriglyceridemia with elevated apo B the lipoprotein manifestation of a condition presumably caused by impaired fatty acid trapping by adipose tissue that Sniderman et al [13] recently coined the Medusa Hypothesis may be the link in this cohort to excess risk both for CVD and for abnormal GM.,Onat_2005.txt,1
In a population sample of obese postmenopausal Turkish women we have recently reported evidence for a complex risk profile among those with hypertriglyceridemia and elevated apo B [14].],Onat_2005.txt,0
[The reason why a divergence between sexes had not been uncovered earlier may not only be related to the characteristics of the population sampled but may also stem from the fact that few studies investigated samples with normal GM as was done here.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Evidence exists namely apart from the present study that in the general population including persons with abnormal GM the greater propensity to DM/ IFG in obese women (than in men) raises the prevalence of MS and its share within MS more in the female sex and consequently abolishes (and perhaps reverses) the gradient in risk for abnormal GM existing between nonobese men and women free of MS. Isomaa et al [15] in investigating the prevalence and cardiovascular risk associated with MS in a large family study of type 2 diabetes in the Botnia study tabulated their data by the status of GT. Hypertension and dyslipidemia with or without obesity were present in the normal GT group in 15% of men vs 8% of women whereas they existed in 31% and 24% respectively of those with IFG/IGT and in 60% and 67% respectively among diabetic individuals.,Onat_2005.txt,0

Our finding on the incidence of newly developing abnormal GM should be commented upon to give a perspective of the insulin resistance underlying the population.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Annual incidences of DM in men and women with normal GM were estimated to be 8.9 and 11.7 per mille respectively and of IFG were 8.0 and 11.9 per mille respectively.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Our DM incidence lies in between the ageadjusted 6.3 per 1000 adults for white Americans and the 10.1 figure for Hispanic Americans [18].,Onat_2005.txt,0
In the middle-aged white male nondiabetic participants of the PROCAM study the annual incidence of DM may be estimated as 8.5 per mille [19].,Onat_2005.txt,0
Our DM incidence is thus comparable with that of Western populations.],Onat_2005.txt,0
[The fact that the annual incidence of abnormal GM was by a third more common in men than in women (15.8 vs 12 per mille) among nonobese participants without MS suggests that the inherent greater susceptibility of men to abnormal GM (perhaps via reduced insulin sensitivity or enhanced visceral adiposity [6] despite lack of obesity) is minimally modified by the acquisition of obesity or MS; in contrast women almost quadruple this risk by acquiring the 2 features.,Onat_2005.txt,0
It has been stated that metabolically obese normal-weight individuals are common in the general population and that central fat distribution and inactivity are among the main factors predisposing them to insulin resistance [20].,Onat_2005.txt,1
"Hazard ratios for diabetes increasing with the number of components of the MS [21,22] and the possibly prevailing 1 or 2 MS components among our male cohort with no MS and no obesity might account for the higher incidence of abnormal GM in men.",Onat_2005.txt,0
Sex differences have been observed in postprandial lipemia.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Examining the response of postprandial TRL to a standardized meal men were characterized not only by a greater visceral adipose tissue accumulation but also by a greater plasma triglyceride response postprandial insulin and free fatty acid levels compared with women suggesting that sex difference in visceral adipose tissue accumulation is an important contributing factor involved in the response in men [23].,Onat_2005.txt,0
Contrasted to the finding of exquisite prediction of DM/ IFG by MS in women the poor prediction in men in the present paper is at apparent variance with the finding of MS as an effective predictor of diabetes in the exclusively male cohort of the West of Scotland Study [21].,Onat_2005.txt,0
In multivariate analysis incorporating conventional risk factors however MS was reported not to be predictive of diabetes.,Onat_2005.txt,0
C-reactive protein has been also linked with the prediction of diabetes in the mentioned study consistent with the notion of an inflammatory element in type 2 diabetes.,Onat_2005.txt,0

With regard to future development of DM/IFG an MS diagnosis in men with or without obesity was not helpful in predicting whereas waist girth greater than 102 cm in men with an MS was indeed a significant predictor independent of age.,Onat_2005.txt,1
This observation underlines that waist girth is the parameter to be watched in men with respect both to CVD risk and to abnormal GM.,Onat_2005.txt,0
It was reported in the 4-year follow-up of 1005 Finnish middle-aged men that the National Cholesterol Education Program definition of MS (including waist N 102 cm) identified persons at high risk for developing diabetes yet that it was less sensitive in predicting diabetes than the World Health Organization definition although being more specific [24].],Onat_2005.txt,1
[Our findings in individuals with abnormal and normal GM were essentially consistent with each other namely MS components other than the combination of obesity and IFG contributed little to the development of subsequent CVD in women whereas the components of MS other than obesity determined subsequent CVD in men.,Onat_2005.txt,0
This suggests that our CV Disease DM MS Obesity Visc. Adip. conclusion on subjects with normal GM was not biased by the exclusion of persons with IFG/DM.,Onat_2005.txt,0
Based on this set of observations the hypothesis that men and women diverge in their pathways from (abdominal) obesity to DM and CVD is supported.,Onat_2005.txt,0
As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 among adults with normal GM obese or abdominally obese women are prone to develop MS and in particular DM; in addition unless they primarily develop DM they run little risk of CVD.,Onat_2005.txt,0
In contrast among men with normal GM susceptibility to abdominal obesity reflecting visceral adiposity via the development of MS rather than obesity per se predicts CVD with little regard to the concurrence of DM.,Onat_2005.txt,0
In the recent NHANES III study MS was indeed found much more important than DM with regard to the likelihood of coronary disease [25] but sex difference was not separately evaluated.,Onat_2005.txt,0
The working hypothesis may be accounted for by postulating a weaker insulin resistance but-as existed in this study-a greater inflammation in obese women with MS than obese men with MS.,Onat_2005.txt,0

The main findings of this Italian longitudinal study of more than 20 000 men and women aged 35-69 years in relation to 10-year CHD incidence of low-risk status (favorable levels of all readily measured modifiable major CVD risk factors) are as follows: at baseline only 2.7% low risk 81.4% high risk (one or more risk factor levels high); only two CHD events in 543 low-risk individuals; and for all persons not high risk (low risk plus unfavorable but not high risk) the age-sex standardized coronary event rate was 62% lower than for those high risk.,Palmieri_2006.txt,1

The limitations of the present study include the small size of low-risk sub-cohorts (male female); the concordant results on CHD here and for the six low-risk cohorts similarly defined (MRFIT Chicago) however support the inference that low risk as defined protects generally against CHD an inference given further broad support by the concordant results from the Nurses Health Study with low risk defined by favorable lifestyle traits [5].,Palmieri_2006.txt,1
A further limitation is that low-risk status is based on only one measurement of the risk factors; this limitation the regression dilution bias problem [30] however leads to some people being improperly designated low risk with resultant underestimation of the favorable effects of low risk.,Palmieri_2006.txt,0
Furthermore there are no data on eating drinking or exercise lifestyle traits implicated as important CVD risk factors; the lack of data on these traits however makes more impressive the benefit against CHD with favorable levels of readily measured modifiable major risk factors and again it is relevant to note the concordant findings from the Nurses Health Study with low risk defined based on multiple lifestyle criteria.,Palmieri_2006.txt,1

It is possible that aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors during the follow-up might have led to a lower risk of death.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
In the group of persons with undiagnosed DM intensive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors was even lower; in fact during the re-evaluation of the cohort we found that a high number of these participants (around 40%) had not even told their primary care physicians about the results of the OGTT and there was no record in their clinical histories.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
"At the end of the follow-up period the percentages of patients receiving hypertension drugs lipid-lowering drugs and anti-platelet aggregators were 64% 36% and The data from this registry are alarming as the different cross-sectional studies that have been carried out in Spain (see the ""Introduction"") suggest that at least half those persons with DM remain undiagnosed whilst the disease remains asymptomatic even over many years.",Valdes_2009.txt,0

The fact that those persons with undiagnosed DM have a significantly higher risk of death than the control group with normoglycemia and a similar risk to those with diagnosed DM underlines the importance of detection in these persons.,Valdes_2009.txt,0

The Asturias Study was designed as a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of type 2 DM and IGT as well as the proportion of persons with undiagnosed DM in the population of Asturias and the sample size was sufficient for these estimations.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
4 Estimation of the risk of death in the different groups would probably have required a larger cohort or longer follow-up period in order to obtain greater precision in the results.,Valdes_2009.txt,0

This rate of participation might affect the representativity of the sample and the extrapolation to the general population of the data obtained.,Valdes_2009.txt,0
Nevertheless in spite of these limitations inherent to the study design itself we consider that the study presents the important advantage of analyzing a representative sample of the general population from the whole province including both rural and urban areas with a complete initial evaluation by means of an OGTT which gave us the unusual opportunity of being able to evaluate mortality in a number of persons with prediabetes and undiagnosed DM a fact that was almost unprecedented in Spain.,Valdes_2009.txt,0

The impairment of glucose tolerance with advancing age is a well-known phenomenon first reported by Spence in 1920 [26].,Stengard_1992.txt,1
"According to recent studies a large proportion of elderly subjects aged 65 years and over have either im paired glucose tolerance or overt diabetes [22,27].",Stengard_1992.txt,1
How ever prognostic importance of diabetes in the elderly is not very well established.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"There is some evidence that the excess mortality risk in diabetic patients diminishes with advancing age and may even disappear at about 75 years of age [2,6].",Stengard_1992.txt,0
A similar age-specific trend was also seen in this study.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"However in agreement with some other earlier findings [9,10] our results showed that diabetes is an im portant predictor of death among elderly men.",Stengard_1992.txt,0
We followed a cohort of elderly Finnish men aged 65 to 84 years for 5 years.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Both diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance were common among these men at baseline [22].,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Approximately one-third of the diabetic patients died during the follow-up.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
The overall mortality risk of these men was twice as high as in men with normal glucose tolerance after the adjustment for age and several major risk factors for chronic diseases.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"This estimate is relatively high compared with the results of previous studies from other populations where mortality risks have been re ported to range usually from 1.0 to 1.4 [2,4,[6][7][8] among diabetic subjects of the same age.",Stengard_1992.txt,0
In one earlier study of el derly Finnish men no association between self-reported diabetes and increased mortality was found [28].,Stengard_1992.txt,0
There are however some methodological differences between previous surveys and our study.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"Definition of diabetes in many previous studies was based on self-reported history of diabetes in a question naire survey [19,28] or they were drawn from a hospital series [2,8,9] or from a special diabetes registry [6][7][8].",Stengard_1992.txt,1
Self-reported diabetes is however subject to several mis classification biases.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Madow [29] found that approximate ly 15 % of the people who had diabetes according to their medical record did not report their disease.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
On the other hand approximately 14 % of the self-reported diabetic patients in the Second National and Nutrition Examin ation Survey in the United States were not diabetic but were misdiagnosed or incorrectly reported themselves as diabetic patients [30).,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Furthermore a section of elderly diabetic subjects are not aware of their disease because it is often asymptomatic.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
The former biases can be avoided if the diagnosis of diabetes is based on an oral glucose tolerance test which has been used in many studies where diabetic subjects were drawn from a registry.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"The use of registries however often brings in such other biases as a selection bias or a referral bias [ 4,31].",Stengard_1992.txt,0
For instance many diabetic patients included in diabetes registries have a relatively severe disease which requires treatment with either oral anti-diabetic drugs or insulin.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Risk estimates derived from such a patient material will be likely to be higher than those obtained in diabetic patients treated with diet only.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
On the other hand relative risk estimates for mortality in these kinds of studies are often calculated either in comparison with the general population or re cruiting the referent subjects from other hospital clinics.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Such reference groups can also include diabetic subjects which may lower the estimated relative risks.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"In some earlier studies mortality estimates among diabetic subjects were based on a review of routine death certification data [1,4].",Stengard_1992.txt,0
"Lack of reliability and validity of death certificates serves as a major source of bias in such studies [ 4,32].",Stengard_1992.txt,0
For instance Fuller and co-workers [32] re ported that diabetes was not mentioned in 33 % of death certificates of known diabetic patients.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
These kinds of biases are less common in well-designed prospective co hort studies where both death certificates and hospital records are systematically collected.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"On the other hand large prospective cohort studies may face problems in mortality follow-up since among the ""survivors"" there may be subjects whose vital status is not exactly known.",Stengard_1992.txt,0
We tried to avoid known biases by testing glucose toler ance of all responders at baseline except subjects receiv ing anti-diabetic medication and those whose fasting blood glucose exceeded 10 mmol/1.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Thus normal glucose tolerance status was also ascertained with the glucose tolerance test.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Furthermore mortality follow-up in our study was complete.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
On the other hand there were 129 men who we could not classify according to their glucose tolerance status at baseline.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Most of them were chroni cally ill and 55 % of them died between 1984 and 1989.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
The contribution of diabetes to their mortality is not known.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
The relative risk of dying among patients using anti diabetic drugs was twice as high as that in diabetic patients treated with diet alone.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
The risk was particularly in creased in insulin-treated subjects.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
It is most likely that el derly individuals whose glycaernic control required in sulin treatment had more severe disease than those who were satisfactorily treated with oral anti-diabetic drugs or diet alone.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
"Thus our results support earlier findings that the severity of diabetes predicts mortality among diabetic patients [1,9].",Stengard_1992.txt,0
"Cardiovascular disease is the most common underlying cause of death among Caucasoid diabetic patients as has been previously shown in several studies [2,4,5,8,[10][11][12][13][14].",Stengard_1992.txt,1
In our study approximately one-half of the deaths in diabetic men were from cardiovascular diseases.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Diabetes doubled the age-specific risk of cardiovascular death among men aged below 75 years but it was not associated J. H. Stengard et al.:,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Mortality in elderly diabetic men with excess risk among older men.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Overall in the diabetes group the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 50 % higher compared with men with normal glucose tolerance.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Due to the relatively small study population the 95 % CI was wide and the risk estimate did not reach sta tistical significance .,Stengard_1992.txt,0
However the excess in absolute mor tality from cardiovascular disease in diabetic men was 66 deaths per 1000 men during the 5-year period compared with men with normal glucose tolerance.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
This indicates that diabetes is a significant determinant for cardiovascu lar death among elderly men.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
On the other hand diabetes alone may not be sufficient for the increased risk of coro nary heart disease because in Pima Indians coronary mor tality is not particularly high despite the extremely high prevalence of diabetes [33].,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Relative risks of death from other non-cardiovascular causes tended also to be increased among diabetic subjects.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Particularly mortality from infectious diseases seemed to be greater among subjects with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance suggesting that abnormal glucose tolerance may increase susceptibility to infec tions.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Both overall mortality rate and mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance have been found to be between that of diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients [16].,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Also in our study mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and from all causes were intermediate among men with impaired glu cose tolerance.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
However the mortality risk estimates did not differ significantly from those obtained in subjects with normal glucose tolerance.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
This may partly reflect the heterogeneity of the impaired glucose tolerance cat egory.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Furthermore several environmental and host fac tors may cause misclassification by the glucose tolerance test.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Among subjects with impaired glucose tolerance the result of the glucose tolerance test has been found to be normal in 10 % to 60% in a repeated test [34].,Stengard_1992.txt,0
In our study the definition of impaired glucose tolerance was based on a single glucose tolerance test many of which were performed in the afternoon.,Stengard_1992.txt,1
Thus some subjects with normal glucose tolerance may have been falsely in cluded in the impaired glucose tolerance category in our study underestimating the importance of impaired glu cose tolerance.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
In conclusion our study shows that diabetes is a signifi cant determinant of mortality among elderly men in Fin land.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Every third diabetic man but only every fifth man with normal glucose tolerance in our cohort died during the 5-year follow up.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
Most of the deaths were from cardio vascular disease.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
These findings suggest that diabetes is an important public health problem among elderly subjects and likely to increase in importance in all populations where the proportion of elderly people is now rapidly in creasing.,Stengard_1992.txt,0
In this general population-based prospective study we found that both diabetes and IFG are associated with a substantial increased risk of all-cause mortality in Chinese adults.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Compared with those with NFG all-cause mortality risk in those with diabetes increased two and half times.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Furthermore there was a *80 % increased mortality from Values are % or mean (SD) Fig.,Shi_2016.txt,0
1 Age-adjusted cumulative of all-cause mortality according to glucose categories: the Jiangsu Nutrition Study all causes among those with IFG.,Shi_2016.txt,0
We also detected an interaction between diabetes and vegetable-rich dietary pattern in relation to mortality.,Shi_2016.txt,0
In those with diabetes who had a low intake of vegetable-rich pattern had an increased risk of mortality compared to those who had a high intake of the pattern.,Shi_2016.txt,0
However overweight and residence (urban/ rural) were not associated with any increase in risk of mortality for those with diabetes.,Shi_2016.txt,0
"A two to three times excess risk of mortality has often been found among those with diabetes as compared with those without diabetes [10,16].",Shi_2016.txt,0
Reductions in all-cause mortality among those with diabetes have occurred over time [26].,Shi_2016.txt,0
The latest data from Sweden suggest that the overall excess risk of death had dropped to a historically low level of 15 % [8].,Shi_2016.txt,0
In the Da Qing Study the ageadjusted relative risk of death from all causes in those with diabetes was three times higher compared with those without diabetes [16].,Shi_2016.txt,0
However the Da Qing study started in 1980s and over the past three decades there has been substantial development in the primary and secondary prevention of diabetes.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Surprisingly the excess risk of mortality in our study remained as high as 2.69 times.,Shi_2016.txt,0
It may underline the poor control of glycaemic level [3] as well as other risk factors among persons with diabetes in China.,Shi_2016.txt,0
In our study the prevalence of smoking was similar to the national average [27].,Shi_2016.txt,0
A very low proportion of patients reported undertaking leisure time physical activity.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Furthermore the consumption of refined wheat rice was high.,Shi_2016.txt,0
In the IFG and diabetes groups the raw rice consumption was 117 and 106 g per 1000 kcal respectively.,Shi_2016.txt,0
These unhealthy lifestyles may lead to the poor control of glycaemic level and contribute to a high proportion of mortality among people with IFG/diabetes in China.,Shi_2016.txt,0
The interaction between diabetes and income suggests that those in the disadvantaged population should be given priority for intervention.,Shi_2016.txt,0
The interaction between diabetes and vegetable-rich dietary pattern is consistent with current knowledge about the beneficial effects of fruit vegetable and whole grain.,Shi_2016.txt,0
The pattern is inversely associated with rice intake.,Shi_2016.txt,0
It is also consistent with current knowledge about the relationship between rice intake and diabetes [17].,Shi_2016.txt,0
Rice has a high glycaemic index and has previously been found to be associated with an increased risk of hyperglycaemia in the cohort [18].,Shi_2016.txt,0
In general a diet with a high glycaemic index impairs glycaemic control.,Shi_2016.txt,0
It has been shown that poor glycaemic control increases the risk of mortality [8].,Shi_2016.txt,1
Overall our study suggests a beneficial effect of engaging in physical activity and a high intake of vegetable-rich dietary pattern among those with diabetes.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Because the prevalence of favourable lifestyle factors in the population is low there appears an opportunity that lifestyle modification will be able to reduce a substantial number of premature deaths among those with diabetes.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Several limitations in our study should be acknowledged.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Firstly although we had 5-year follow-up due to the high attrition rate we decided not to incorporate the data at follow-up.,Shi_2016.txt,0
During a 5-year follow-up 125 developed IFG/diabetes among 1056 participants with NFG at baseline.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Therefore our study may underestimate the risk of mortality among those with diabetes or IFG.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Secondly due to the small number of deaths we could not further analyse mortality due to specific CVD outcomes due to lack of statistical power.,Shi_2016.txt,0
We also note that the number of deaths among those with diabetes was low and this has led to some uncertainty in our findings especially for CVD mortality.,Shi_2016.txt,0
However despite this the magnitude of HR of diabetes for all-cause and CVD mortality is in line with several well-established studies suggesting that our results are not likely to be due to chance.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Education was positively with the intake of vegetable-rich dietary pattern in the sample but income was inversely associated with vegetable-rich dietary pattern (data not shown).,Shi_2016.txt,0
Thus the interaction between vegetablerich dietary pattern and IFG/diabetes could be confounded by socioeconomic status.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Although we have adjusted for education and income in the multivariable model residual confounding is still possible.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Furthermore dietary intake was not continuously measured during follow-up.,Shi_2016.txt,0
The eating habits could change during the ten-year period.,Shi_2016.txt,0
Finally in our study diabetes was based on fasting glucose and selfreported known diabetes.,Shi_2016.txt,0
It is known that the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is high in China.,Shi_2016.txt,0
An underestimation of the prevalence of diabetes is highly likely and this may affect the outcomes of the study.,Shi_2016.txt,0
The strength of the study is the face-to-face-based interview by well-trained health workers at baseline as well as the use of 3-day WFR to measure energy and nutrients intake.,Shi_2016.txt,0
The study included both urban and rural participants.,Shi_2016.txt,0
It can be generalized in the study population to the province with over 70 million residents.,Shi_2016.txt,0
However whether the findings can be generalized in the whole Chinese population is not clear.,Shi_2016.txt,0
In conclusion diabetes and IFG are associated with an increased risk of death in Chinese adults.,Shi_2016.txt,0
A high intake of vegetable-rich dietary pattern is associated with decreased risk of mortality for those with diabetes.,Shi_2016.txt,0
There is no interaction between the rice-based traditional dietary pattern and IFG/diabetes.,Shi_2016.txt,0

Our fi ndings complement existing evidence and extend previous fi ndings in ARIC.,Warren_2017.txt,0
One ARIC study 22 found that fasting glucose concentration of 5•6-6•9 mmol/L and 2 h glucose of 7•8-11•0 mmol/L had similar associations with incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality during a median follow-up time of 6•3 years.,Warren_2017.txt,1
Our results confi rm these fi ndings but with approximately 10 more years of follow-up and more incident events.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Our fi ndings are also consistent with results from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) 23 a 73-study participant-level meta-analysis of 294 998 individuals.,Warren_2017.txt,0
The ERFC study found that compared with fasting glucose random glucose or postload glucose HbA 1c provided a small but signifi cant improvement in the C-statistic for discrimination of cardiovascular disease risk.,Warren_2017.txt,0
By contrast in the 2001 DECODE study 24 of 22 514 participants from ten diff erent European centres followed up for 8•8 years 2 h glucose was more strongly associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality than was fasting glucose concentration.,Warren_2017.txt,0
We do note that measurements in diff erent blood specimens (plasma whole blood) were collected in DECODE across the ten European centres.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Methodological and study population diff erences notwithstanding the reasons why our results do not agree with the DECODE fi ndings are unclear.,Warren_2017.txt,0
"Meta-analyses 25,26 have also shown confl icting results for whether impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes.",Warren_2017.txt,0
Several limitations of our study should be considered in the interpretation of our fi ndings.,Warren_2017.txt,0
First we did not have concurrent measurements of fasting glucose HbA 1c  and 2 h glucose and all classifi cations were based on single measurements whereas in clinical practice these measurements might be repeated.,Warren_2017.txt,0
In practice clinical decisions are based on a compendium of laboratory clinical and epidemiological information.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Nonetheless for prediabetes there are currently no formal recommendations or consensus regarding repeating tests for confi rmation.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Second as part of the ARIC study protocol abnormal laboratory values including raised fasting glucose concentration (>11•1 mmol/L) or 2 h glucose (>16•7 mmol/L) were reported back to the participants although less than 1•5% of participants had elevated values that prompted a report.,Warren_2017.txt,1
HbA 1c results at visit 2 were not reported to participants as they were measured retrospectively (>10 years after sample collection).,Warren_2017.txt,0
The reporting of the glucose measures to participants might have increased the probability of a diagnosis of diabetes.,Warren_2017.txt,0
27 Third we used a defi nition of incident diabetes based on self-report.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Fourth our fi ndings might not be generalisable beyond black and white Americans.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Fifth despite the large sample size and number of events the possibility exists that the study might have been underpowered to detect moderate diff erences between defi nitions particularly given the overlap of defi nitions.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Finally although our results in ARIC were consistent with fi ndings for allcause and cardiovascular mortality in NHANES III further replication especially for other major complications in diverse populations is needed.,Warren_2017.txt,0
The strengths of this study include our ability to compare the prognostic value of multiple defi nitions of prediabetes rigorous assessment of hyperglycaemia and related risk factors with standardised protocols and trained personnel active surveillance for major clinical complications and over two decades of follow-up in a large community-based population.,Warren_2017.txt,0
A number of considerations need to be weighed when deciding between defi nitions of prediabetes for screening programmes and the optimal choice will depend on objectives.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Long-term risk associations along with considerations such as cost availability and the specifi c strengths and weaknesses of each biomarker are all relevant.,Warren_2017.txt,0
It is diffi cult to establish whether a strategy that would identify large numbers of people including many people at low risk of future outcomes might be more benefi cial than strategies that are highly specifi c but might miss some high-risk individuals who should receive preventive interventions.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Prediabetes defi ned by ADA and IEC HbA 1c cutoff s and WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff s identifi ed fewer people but these defi nitions were more specifi c for the identifi cation of people at risk for long-term outcomes.,Warren_2017.txt,1
HbA 1c -based defi nitions had higher relative risk associations and showed small but statistically signifi cant improvements in risk discrimination for a broad range of clinical complications.,Warren_2017.txt,0
Whereas prediabetes defi ned by ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff s was more sensitive it was not as strongly associated with long-term risk of clinical complications.,Warren_2017.txt,1
For long-term prediction of clinical outcomes prediabetes defi nitions based on 2 h glucose concentration did not better predict the risk of chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular outcomes than fasting glucose concentration.,Warren_2017.txt,0
The comparative usefulness of diff erent defi nitions of prediabetes will vary depending on the goals of the screening programme; however data on long-term prognostic performance can and should help to inform use of and recommendations for diff erent defi nitions of prediabetes.],Warren_2017.txt,0

We show marked ethnic differences in associations between prediabetes and CVD.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Prediabetes was related to both CHD and CVD risk in Europeans but not South Asians.,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Strongest associations were observed for IEC rather than for ADA and OGTT criteria.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
In contrast only South Asians demonstrated an association between prediabetes and stroke.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Associations persisted on multivariate adjustment and on accounting for differential rates of incident diabetes diagnosis.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Ethnic differences in baseline and follow-up CVD risk factor control may account for our findings (lipids for CHD in Europeans and blood pressure for stroke in South Asians).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
The greater prevalence of prediabetes when defined by HbA 1c as opposed to glucose-based criteria in South Asians not observed in Europeans corresponds with previous findings (17).,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
However we do not corroborate suggestions that classifying a higher number of South Asians as having prediabetes when HbA 1c criteria are used results in a less discriminative indicator of CVD risk (18) since for CHD prediabetes by any criterion appeared unrelated in South Asians for stroke prediabetes by all criteria was associated.,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
"For Europeans modest associations between prediabetes and CHD correspond with previous findings (6,7).",Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Associations between prediabetes by IEC HbA 1c criteria and CHD were stronger than those for glucose reflecting either greater reproducibility of HbA 1c (27) or better capture of fed-state glycemic status which may more closely associate with CHD (10).,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
There are no comparable prospective data for South Asians.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
The INTERHEART case-control study reported a greater risk of myocardial infarction in the highest versus lowest quintile of HbA 1c in Western Europeans but not South Asians (28) the latter corroborated by cross-sectional data (29).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Elevated lipids are key determinants of CHD risk (30).,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
Total and LDL cholesterol in those on lipid-lowering medication at follow-up were higher in Europeans than South Asians with prediabetes in SABRE reflecting findings in people with diabetes (31).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Poor lipid control in Europeans with prediabetes may have contributed to excess CHD risks compared with normoglycemic individuals (and conversely better control in South Asians may account for the lack of excess CHD in prediabetes).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Conversion rates from prediabetes to overt diabetes were higher in South Asians than Europeans occurring at an earlier age (26).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
This may have resulted in more aggressive and long-standing lipid management.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Another possibility is that South Asians respond better to lipid lowering (32) though this appears unlikely (33).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
No associations were found between prediabetes and stroke for Europeans whereas strong associations were seen in South Asians for all three criteria.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"Previous studies of Europeans report weak associations between fasting glucose postload glucose HbA 1c  and stroke (6,7).",Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Stroke numbers were modest in SABRE and may reflect better blood pressure control than historical cohorts.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
However blood pressure control in those with prediabetes on antihypertensives was worse in South Asians than Europeans at both baseline and follow-up suggesting suboptimal management of this key stroke risk factor (34).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"This may account for the positive association between prediabetes and stroke in South Asians again related to higher diabetes conversion rates since blood pressure appears harder to control in South Asians than Europeans with diabetes (35,36).",Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"In addition to its use indicating likely progression to overt diabetes prediabetes incorporation into CVD risk scoring systems (14) or its use as a treatment target per se has been proposed (3,4).",Eastwood_2015.txt,1
However the amalgamation of CHD and stroke risk may result in undertreatment of stroke risk in South Asians.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Furthermore our findings indicate that prediabetes is linked to overall CVD risk in Europeans only and only for HbA 1cdefined prediabetes which suggests questioning the adoption of prediabetes as a trigger for population-level primary prevention.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"""Mechanistically these findings suggest that glycemia may be more related to microvascular (stroke) than macrovascular (CHD) disease in South Asians than Europeans.",Eastwood_2015.txt,0
We have described greater levels of retinal rarefaction (37) poorer microvascular responses to ischemia (38) and more adverse cerebral circulatory autoregulation (39) and others report greater cerebral microvascular disease (40) in South Asians than Europeans with evidence that the latter two findings were mediated by hyperglycemia.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Furthermore we have shown that the South Asian excess of stroke is largely explained by diabetes commensurate with the current studys results regarding prediabetes (16).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"However it is unclear why nondiabetic glycemia is not so obviously related to CHD in South Asians (28,29).",Eastwood_2015.txt,0
This study is novel in comparing associations between prediabetes and CVD in South Asians and Europeans.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Strengths include the use of three different diagnostic criteria for prediabetes.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
HbA 1c was not available on all participants at baseline and as with any cohort study loss to follow-up may have introduced bias.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
However 88% of Europeans and 90% of South Asians were followed up and analyses comparing 1) those with and without a full set of baseline bloods and 2) responders and nonresponders did not detect bias.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Bias may have arisen from exposure misclassification especially given the high variability of glucose measurements (27) though this is less likely for HbA 1c .,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
While the study was well powered for CHD and CVD analyses the relatively small number of strokes made interpretation of associations more difficult though internal validity was demonstrated since associations between all prediabetes measures and stroke were similar.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Confounders such as use of and response to antihypertensive and lipidlowering medication will have varied over time.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
We attempted to address this by examination of follow-up clinic data.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
"Finally the South Asians in our study were of Indian origin and may not necessarily apply to other South Asian subgroups.""",Eastwood_2015.txt,0
In summary we show relations between prediabetes and CVD outcomes,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
The main finding of the current study is that hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of stroke events in persons without a previous diagnosis of DM.,Sui_2011.txt,0
We found an initial flat association that became linear at 110 mg/dL or greater between FPG level and fatal nonfatal and total stroke in asymptomatic men.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Multivariable models showed that IFG was strongly associated with fatal stroke and that undiagnosed DM was strongly associated with nonfatal and total stroke.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Importantly a greater risk of stroke was detected at an FPG level of 110 mg/dL and not at 100 mg/dL which challenges the current ADA recommendations at least in terms of stroke risk.,Sui_2011.txt,0

Such persons should be identified as high-risk and receive primary prevention for stroke.,Sui_2011.txt,0
"Some 9,10 but not all 6,11,12 studies have reported an increased risk of stroke in those with elevated serum fasting glucose levels and in those with undiagnosed DM defined by FPG.",Sui_2011.txt,1
"In a study population of 13,999 patients from Israel with documented coronary heart disease Tanne et al 9 reported an 84% higher risk of incident nonfatal ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with an FPG of 110 to 125 mg/dL but a nonsignificant higher risk for those with an FPG of 100 to 109 mg/dL.",Sui_2011.txt,1
Recently the DECODE study 10 a significantly increased hazard ratio for both IFG (1.18 [95% CI 1.00-1.40]) and for screen-detected DM (1.36 [95% CI 1.02-1.80]).,Sui_2011.txt,0
"However neither that study 11,12 nor the Euro Heart Survey on Diabetes and the Heart 6 showed an association between FPG levels and stroke mortality perhaps indicating that the previous inconsistent findings between FPG levels and stroke events could be due to the different types of stroke outcomes.",Sui_2011.txt,0
Therefore to evaluate the precise role of FPG in the primary prevention of stroke it is important to investigate various stroke outcomes in asymptomatic persons.,Sui_2011.txt,0
In the current study we found a strong association between FPG levels and stroke in men with IFG (for fatal stroke) and undiagnosed DM (for nonfatal or total stroke) after multivariable adjustment.,Sui_2011.txt,0
When FPG was used as a continuous variable in the analysis every 10-unit increment of FPG above 110 mg/dL was associated with an 8% and 6% higher risk of nonfatal and total stroke respectively (Table 3).,Sui_2011.txt,1
Some previous studies have shown that the association between FPG levels and stroke outcomes differs by sex.,Sui_2011.txt,0
For example the DECODE Study Group reported a strong positive association between FPG and stroke mortality in women but not in men.,Sui_2011.txt,0
"12 However most other studies did not separate men and women 6,[9][10][11] and therefore sex-specific studies are needed to clarify this issue.",Sui_2011.txt,0
We were unable to conduct such an analysis in women because of the small number of women and stroke deaths identified from the ACLS.,Sui_2011.txt,0
As the ACLS cohort expands we are hoping to update our results especially in women in the near future.,Sui_2011.txt,0
One of the potential biological mechanisms is that hyperglycemia may cause early atherosclerosis in the initial phases of DM. 34,Sui_2011.txt,0
"Atherosclerotic lesions often develop at an accelerated rate in the large arteries in people with undiagnosed DM. 9 Many factors such as hyperglycemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction procoagulation acceleration fibrinolysis failure and arterial remodeling dysfunction may play a role in the prognosis of patients with higher levels of FPG. 35,36 Laboratory data also suggest that increased levels of blood glucose may lead to infarct expansion through several maladaptive metabolic pathways.",Sui_2011.txt,0

The principal strength of the current study is the large population and extensive database generated during the past 30 years.,Sui_2011.txt,0
The primary limitation is the homogeneity of the cohort on socioeconomic variables: this study population comprises mainly non-Hispanic whites from middle to upper socioeconomic strata who are college graduates.,Sui_2011.txt,0
However the physiologic characteristics of our study population were similar to those of representative population groups.,Sui_2011.txt,0
38,Sui_2011.txt,0
The homogeneity of the cohort on socioeconomic variables may reduce the possibility of confounding by education occupation and income.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Because of their higher socioeconomic status people in this cohort are likely to For personal use.,Sui_2011.txt,0
have better access to medical services than members of the general population which may explain in part their lower stroke rate.,Sui_2011.txt,0
"The expected age-adjusted stroke mortality rate in the current cohort was 37.9 per 100,000 US standard population which was slightly lower than the 2007 age-adjusted rate for US adults (42.2 per 100,000 US standard population).",Sui_2011.txt,0
39 Another limitation of the current study is that we were unable to consider the stroke subtype.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Given the size and nationwide distribution of our cohort medical record reviewing is an ongoing process and we have not yet completed this process on all reported cases.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Therefore we do not have sufficient information to identify ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Recent literature reported a J-shaped association between FPG levels and ischemic stroke in patients with preexisting atherothrombotic disease.,Sui_2011.txt,0
9 More research is needed to better understand the specificity of associations between FPG levels and stroke subtypes.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Regarding the exposure assessment we only had a single measurement of FPG which deviates from the ADA criteria for DM classification and might lead to misclassification of the exposure variable.,Sui_2011.txt,0
In addition men were classified at study enrollment and so we were unable to assess the influence of follow-up changes in FPG levels on stroke end points.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Men initially classified as having IFG could have had increases in FPG levels developed DM or been treated with glucose-lowing medications during the follow-up interval.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Additionally others with normal glucose levels could have transitioned to IFG and some with IFG may have reverted to normal FPG levels.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Such misclassification of exposure would likely affect the observed association in the current study.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Other risk factors such as screening guidelines aggressiveness of DM interventions and advanced imaging technology studies also changed during the long period of follow-up and the effect on results is unknown.,Sui_2011.txt,0
It is also important to recognize that defining IFG by different criteria might result in other findings.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Furthermore we do not have complete data on some identified inflammatory markers (eg C-reactive protein) to include in the current study.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Other information such as aspirin use dietary habits glycated hemoglobin levels and oral glucose tolerance testing was also unavailable.,Sui_2011.txt,0
In this study approximately 12% of community dwelling older adults who were free of CHD at baseline developed AP over 12.2 years of follow-up.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
While the incidence of AP was greater in persons with DM after adjustment for age and other risk factors important predictors of AP were limited to male sex higher LDL-C triglycerides SBP antihypertensive medication and difficulty with at least one IADL.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
"Prior studies have found AP to be more prevalent in women as compared to men particularly among younger patients and those with DM. 8,9 However in the general population of US adults over age 40 years AP prevalence has ranged from between 8% and 11% for men and 5%-9% for women over the age of 65 years.",Mathenge_2020.txt,1
19 Our study further shows incidence rates of AP to be consistently higher in older men compared to older women among those with pre-DM DM or neither condition with adjusted risks showing men overall to be 40% more likely to develop incident AP than women.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
"The lower incidence rates of AP among women may reflect a sex-specific difference in AP symptom recognition reporting and evaluation 6,20 or may reflect sex-specific differences in the development of atherosclerosis.",Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Our findings further demonstrate a disparity in sex-specific AP incidence among older adults during long-term follow up.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Furthermore the difference between known AP prevalence and incidence is noteworthy.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
A retrospective study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1998 to 2012 reported a decline in the prevalence of AP in US adults particularly in individuals aged ⩾65 years (decline from 9.4% in 2001-2004 to 5.1% in 2009-2012 among women; and from 11.0% in 2001-2004 to 7.8% in 2009-2012 among men).,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
19 NHANES data on AP prevalence were derived from Rose Questionnaires of AP symptoms and self-reported survey information which can lead to an underestimation of AP prevalence.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Our study with physician-adjudicated criteria for incident AP from the CHS offers unique insight into the incidence of AP in older adults over longer term follow up not reflected in prior studies.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0

21 A recent study from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Diseases reported that in a comparatively younger patient population (median age 64 years) 22 prevalent AP was associated with a similar risk of CV hospitalization revascularization and all-cause mortality regardless of DM status.,Mathenge_2020.txt,1
The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support an association between different clinical outcomes in patients with AP based solely on DM status.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
22 Moreover Zellweger and colleagues 23 have shown the extent of objective evidence of coronary disease as well as MI or cardiac death were similar in those with and without AP.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0

This sex-specific difference in CHD mortality among those with DM with AP versus DM without AP was not seen in men. 24 Although the incidence of AP was found to be lower among older women compared to men in our study studies have shown that women tend to have a poorer prognosis and higher morbidity once AP develops.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0

[25][26][27],Mathenge_2020.txt,0
"Prior findings have suggested that decreased cognitive function may lead to an increased risk of CVD and CVD death 26,27 likely given the overlap of risk factors related to CVD and vascular-disease-mediated cognitive decline.",Mathenge_2020.txt,0
28,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
In a recent analysis from the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) 27 the link between cognitive impairment and incident CVD was examined in older post-menopausal women who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
The 3MS score was used as the measure of cognitive function at baseline and prospectively with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
27 Our results are consistent with these findings:,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Cognitive function similarly measured by the 3MS score was not an independent predictor of incident AP among older men or women in the CHS cohort.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Interestingly when stratified by DM status those with AP and DM were less likely to be college graduates as compared to those without AP and with DM.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
"Further investigation regarding the association between cognitive function and incident AP in a more ethnically diverse cohort of patients with lower cognitive function scores and education level at baseline may reveal an association between lower cognitive function and incident AP not captured by our specific cohort of predominantly White older adults.""",Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Prior reports have assessed the association between AP and physical activity 8 showing that community-based adults with AP have significantly more limitations in   physical functioning compared to those without AP with worse limitations in physical activity observed in adults with AP who also have DM.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
In our cohort of older adults we further assessed the impact of baseline physical functioning by determining specific exercise intensity levels on the development of incident AP.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
In our study we showed that in women those with difficulty with at least one ADL had a 65% greater risk of developing AP.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
We found that levels of baseline exercise intensity were not independently associated with development of AP.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
The possibility that more intense physical activity could have precipitated angina in some persons cannot be excluded.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Strengths of our study include the large sample size the prospective study design of the Cardiovascular Health Study with long term follow up and the availability of well-characterized and standardized CVD and sociodemographic risk factors.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Notably all self-reported CHD was verified by medical records and baseline EKG findings and CHS criteria for adjudicated baseline and incident AP also included physician diagnosis along with a positive medical history obtained using the Rose questionnaire AP medical therapy or the development of an ischemic end point such as coronary artery bypass surgery ⩾70% blockage of a coronary artery or ST depression >1 mm on exercise stress testing.,Mathenge_2020.txt,1
"13,28 The Rose questionnaire has previously been validated as a tool for use in AP determination in epidemiological studies.",Mathenge_2020.txt,0
"19,20",Mathenge_2020.txt,0
In addition participants who developed incident non-fatal MI and coronary death were censored in the analysis thus reducing the likelihood of misclassification and validating the results of our cohort vis-a-vis participants with incident AP.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Our study is one of the few that provide further insight into the predictors of incident AP in older communitydwelling adults while uniquely assessing the impact of DM and pre-DM along with sex differences as independent risk factors in this special population over a long-term follow up period.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
There are several limitations of our study.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
First the Cardiovascular Health Study was comprised of White and African-American participants but a limited number of participants of other ethnicities which may limit the generalizability of our findings among more diverse populations.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Also since subjects did not routinely receive ischemic testing or coronary angiography at baseline or in conjunction with the development of AP we cannot exclude the possibility of significant coronary disease or ischaemia being present in some included persons at baseline.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Furthermore although atherosclerotic obstructive disease of the epicardial coronary arteries is the most common cause of AP other causes may include coronary artery spasm or endothelial dysfunction.,Mathenge_2020.txt,1
In addition duration of DM and pre-DM could not be ascertained at baseline; thus potential variations in disease severity could not be controlled for within our multivariate analysis.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Further investigation that combines a temporal assessment of the relationship of incident DM and pre-DM to the development of incident AP with extension to subsequent cardiovascular mortality would enhance the findings of our study.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Our results show that while persons with DM have a greater incidence of AP this is largely explained by other CHD risk factors -in particular male sex higher LDL-C triglycerides SBP antihypertensive medication and difficulty with at least one IADL.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
Moreover there are sexspecific differences in predictors of incident AP risk in older adults which may be considerations for sex-specific strategies aimed at preventing AP in these individuals.,Mathenge_2020.txt,0
In middle-aged men risk of CHD and diabetes increased significantly and progressively with increasing number of metabolic abnormalities.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
These findings emphasize the importance of intervention even in those with two metabolic abnormalities.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
The metabolic syndrome (NCEP definition) is associated with a significant increase in risk of CHD stroke and diabetes and is a far stronger predictor of diabetes than of CHD and stroke in middle-aged men.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
Although it is inferior to the FRS in predicting total CHD and in particular heart attacks the metabolic syndrome identifies people who are predisposed to either CVD or diabetes.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
While the initial aim to use the metabolic syndrome to improve risk prediction of CHD has been disappointing the metabolic syndrome (number of metabolic abnormalities) may still be a useful concept.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,1
It may serve as a simple clinical approach to identifying patients at high risk of both diabetes and CVD who may reduce their risk by lifestyle intervention such as weight reduction and improved physical activity.,Wannamethee_2008.txt,0
In the present study the MetS defined by all present criteria except for the ACE definition predicted stroke in elderly Finnish subjects.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Even after the adjustment for individual components of the MetS the MetS by the EGIR and IDF definitions was predictive of stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,1
The IDF definition was the best predictor of stroke among all definitions.,Wang_2008.txt,1
One of the single components of the MetS IGT predicted stroke comparably with the MetS defined by the WHO NCEP and updated NCEP definitions.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Several prospective studies have evaluated the value of the NCEP and WHO definitions to predict stroke 19 -23 but most of these studies have used modified definitions other than those originally proposed.,Wang_2008.txt,1
19 -21 Moreover these studies have varied with respect to characteristics of the baseline population number of deaths and statistical analyses.,Wang_2008.txt,0
The Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Two-Township Study 22 reported that the NCEP criteria predicted ischemic stroke (HR 4.30) in 3453 subjects without excluding initial diabetes and CHD.,Wang_2008.txt,1
In that study the diagnoses of diabetes and CHD were based on the self-report instead of an oral glucose tolerance test and clinical records.,Wang_2008.txt,0
The Framingham Offspring Study 23 also found that the MetS defined by the NCEP criteria was associated with stroke but the subjects with CHD at baseline were not excluded from the study.,Wang_2008.txt,1
The diagnosis of diabetes was not based on an oral glucose tolerance test but instead on fasting plasma glucose or receiving treatment of diabetes.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Our study has several advantages.,Wang_2008.txt,0
First this is a prospective population-based study investigating the relationship between stroke and the MetS using all 6 present criteria including all components of each definition.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Second because diabetes is a powerful predictor of stroke independently of the MetS 23 an oral glucose tolerance test was used to exclude all diabetic subjects from our study.,Wang_2008.txt,0
Third considering that the MetS is associated with CHD 18 we also investigated the MetS as a predictor of stroke in subjects without MI at baseline.,Wang_2008.txt,0
Fourth our study was performed in a population of elderly subjects in whom most events of stroke occur.,Wang_2008.txt,0
Finally because it is unclear whether the MetS predicts stroke above and beyond its individual components our study investigated this issue using c-statistic.,Wang_2008.txt,0
Among the single components of the 6 definitions for the MetS insulin resistance (upper quartile of fasting insulin) by the EGIR and central obesity by the NCEP criteria were ] [associated with incident stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Accordingly the EGIR and IDF definitions which included insulin resistance or central obesity as obligatory components in their definitions were predictive of stroke events.,Wang_2008.txt,1
The other definitions such as the WHO NCEP and updated NCEP which included obesity as a single component despite different definitions for obesity also predicted stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,1
In contrast the ACE definition excluded obesity from its definition and did not predict stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,1
In our study if obesity especially central obesity was included in the definition of the MetS then the MetS predicted stroke supporting the conclusions reported in the previous studies.,Wang_2008.txt,1
We also found that IGT predicted stroke with a HR that was comparable with those of the WHO NCEP and updated NCEP criteria.,Wang_2008.txt,0
This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that IGT predicted fatal stroke in elderly subjects.,Wang_2008.txt,0
32,Wang_2008.txt,0
Our results based on c-statistic and Cox analyses suggest that IGT predicted stroke events above and beyond the ACE definition.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Furthermore the MetS defined by other 5 criteria was a stronger predictor of stroke events than its individual components.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Although hypertension is a classic risk factor for stroke 33 our data did not show any association between elevated blood pressure and stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,0
Two reasons could explain this finding.,Wang_2008.txt,0
First our study was a population-based study in elderly subjects who have higher blood pressure levels than younger persons.,Wang_2008.txt,0
Second even though mean blood pressure levels have decreased markedly during the past 30 years the prevalence of hypertension in Finland is still among the highest in the world.,Wang_2008.txt,0
"34,35",Wang_2008.txt,0
In our study 81.1% had hypertension according to blood pressure Ն140/90mm Hg.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Thus the high prevalence of hypertension in the entire study cohort makes it difficult to demonstrate the effect of blood pressure on the risk of stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,0
However if hypertension was defined only by treatment of antihypertensive medication hypertension tended to be associated with stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Because of quite a small number of stroke events analyses could not be performed in subgroups according to the category of stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,0
This is a limitation of our study.,Wang_2008.txt,0
In addition the absence of middle-aged individuals in the cohort may lead to bias of the incidence of stroke.,Wang_2008.txt,0
However a recent Finnish study in middle-aged men reported similar results to ours based on the NCEP and modified WHO criteria.,Wang_2008.txt,0
21 Because of several definitions of the MetS multiple testing also increases the likelihood of false-positive probability values.,Wang_2008.txt,0
In conclusion the MetS defined by all 6 criteria except for the ACE definition predicts incident stroke in elderly subjects.,Wang_2008.txt,1
However IGT alone is as strong a predictor of stroke as the MetS according to the WHO NCEP and updated NCEP criteria.,Wang_2008.txt,1
Therefore our results may indicate that the MetS defined by the 6 present criteria except for the ACE definition predicts stroke events possibly even above and beyond its individual components.,Wang_2008.txt,1
"Several previous cohort studies which have included Asian subjects have shown that hyperglycaemia increases the risk for CVD morbidity and mortality [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,30].",Nakagami_2004.txt,1
"The excess risk starts at glucose concentrations well below the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes by current diagnostic criteria [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21].",Nakagami_2004.txt,1
Our study which was based on five cohorts with populations of Asian origin and had a 5-year median follow-up showed that post-challenge glucose was an independent predictor of CVD and all-cause mortality among people without previously diagnosed diabetes.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
The association was graded with higher 2-h PG predicting higher mortality.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
When the data were analysed according to glucose categories it was found that with regard to the prediction of premature death post-challenge glucose (2-h PG) Fig. 1a b. Individual (◆ or ■) and overall (❚) hazard ratios and 95% CIs (lines) for all-cause mortality among subjects without previously diagnosed diabetes.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Ratios are shown according to one standard deviation increase in natural log-transformed fasting (◆) (a) and 2-h (■) (b) plasma glucose concentrations in an OGTT adjusting for age sex BMI systolic blood pressure total cholesterol and smoking status Fig. 2a b. Individual (◆ or ■) and overall (❚) hazard ratios and 95% CIs (lines) for cardiovascular mortality among subjects without previously diagnosed diabetes.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"Ratios are shown according to one standard deviation increase in natural logtransformed fasting (◆) (a) and 2-h (■) (b) plasma glucose concentrations in an OGTT adjusting for age sex BMI systolic blood pressure total cholesterol and smoking status was superior to fasting glucose in these Asian populations as previously shown for European populations [20,21].",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
In our study the effect of FPG and/or 2-h PG associated with increased risks of all-cause and CVD mor-tality was homogeneous across cohorts although baseline mean values of CVD risk factors the prevalence of diabetes and rates of CVD and all-cause mortality were different being highest in Asian Indians intermediate in Japanese immigrants and lowest in ethnic Japanese people living in Japan.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Moreover the magnitude of the increased risk in the overall cohort was similar for FPG and 2-h PG.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
It showed a graded relation with CVD and all-cause mortality independent of known CVD risk factors:,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
The relative risk increased 14% for all-cause mortality and 24% for CVD mortality when FPG increased from 7.0 to 8.0 mmol/l.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
A corresponding increase of 2-h PG from 9.0 to 11.9 mmol/l increased all-cause mortality by 29% and CVD mortality by 35%.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"Similar graded relations between glucose concentrations and CVD and all-cause mortality have been found in white populations [13,36].",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"Over an observation period which was half as long as that in Europe [20,21] subjects with IGT based on 2-h PG concentrations (7.8-11.0 mmol/l) had a significantly greater risk of all-cause mortality than people with normal 2-h PG concentrations (<7.8 mmol/l).",Nakagami_2004.txt,1
However subjects with IFG based on FPG concentrations (6.1-6.9 mmol/l) did not have a a greater risk of death than subjects with normal FPG (<6.1 mmol/l) in our study.,Nakagami_2004.txt,1
It is possible that the excess risk of CVD mortality in subjects with IGT based on 2-h PG criteria (7.8-11.0 mmol/l) would have reached significance if those with previous CVD events had been excluded from the analysis.,Nakagami_2004.txt,1
In an 8-year follow-up of elderly non-diabetic Dutch people [16] the predictive ability of post-challenge glucose on CVD mortality dramatically improved and became statistically significant when subjects with previous CVD events were excluded.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
This could not be done in our study because previous CVD events were defined by different criteria among the studies included in our analysis so the validity of this information could not be assured.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"Several recent reports from prospective epidemiological studies have suggested that CVD is more strongly associated with 2-h PG than with FPG [17,19,20,21,36,37].",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
This stronger association with 2-h PG has also been reported for the degree of carotid atherosclerosis [38] and coronary atherosclerosis [39].,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Although the mechanisms underlying these associations are not yet understood it is noteworthy that the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study recently reported that higher acute-phase proteins indicative of chronic sub-clinical inflammation have a stronger relation to 2-h PG than to FPG [40] and insulin resistance [41].,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Alternatively increased 2-h PG concentrations could be a reflection of impaired early-phase glucose-stimulated insulin release which could in turn increase oxidative stress [42] thus accounting for these findings.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Among people diagnosed with diabetes either on the basis of FPG or 2-h PG concentrations we showed that risk of death from CVD and all causes was higher than in people with the corresponding normal glucose categories.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
However the excess risk observed in the diabetic FPG range disappeared after adjustment for 2-h PG.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
In contrast the prediction of death obtained with 2-h PG was not influenced by FPG.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"These findings underscore reports from Europe [20,21] that diagnostic criteria based on post-challenge glucose are more effective in predicting premature death than criteria based on fasting glucose.",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"Isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia is common in elderly women [37] and among non-obese European [20,21,43] and southern hemisphere populations [30].",Nakagami_2004.txt,1
In the studies cited subjects with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia also had an excess risk of CVD mortality.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
We found that 43% of all newly diagnosed cases of diabetes were detected by post-challenge glucose alone and that these subjects had an equal risk of death from CVD and all causes as people diagnosed by fasting glucose.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Thus using only fasting glucose to screen for Type 2 diabetes in Asians will fail to detect nearly half of the persons with previously undiagnosed diabetes and a very high risk of premature death.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
We found that subjects with IFG based on FPG criteria (6.1-6.9 mmol/l) had higher age-standardised allcause and CVD mortality than those with IGT based on 2-h PG criteria (7.8-11.0 mmol/l).,Nakagami_2004.txt,1
However the excess risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in people with IFG based on FPG criteria compared with that in people with normal FPG based on FPG criteria (<6.1 mmol/l) was largely dependent on the 2-h PG concentration.,Nakagami_2004.txt,1
In contrast the excess risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in participants with IGT based on 2-h PG criteria compared with people with normal 2-h PG concentrations based on 2-h PG criteria (<7.8 mmol/l) was not influenced by FPG concentrations.,Nakagami_2004.txt,1
Thus among non-diabetic Asians IGT based on 2-h PG criteria seems to be more effective than IFG based on FPG criteria in predicting premature death.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"This observation is consistent with findings for European populations [20,21].",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
The clinical implications however are less clear.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"Three different trials [44,45,46] have shown that non-diabetic persons with a 2-h PG concentration in the IGT range can prevent progression to diabetes but none of these trials showed a reduction of CVD events.",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
The recent STOP-NIDDM trial showed a 49% risk reduction in CVD events in IGT patients treated with acarbose [47].,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
The British Fasting Hyperglycaemia Study did not show any benefit on the development of diabetes with lifestyle change among subjects with IFG [48].,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
In relation to screening for diabetes the epidemiological data in combination with the clinical trials suggest that 2-h PG has a stronger prognostic implication than FPG although both are highly correlated.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
It is therefore important to also identify people with isolated high 2-h PG values.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
In the DECODE study [20] the excess risk of death from all causes was similar between people with isolated IGT and people with isolated IFG.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"The majority of subjects with IGR also had isolated IGT [20,21].",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
These results emphasise the importance of identi-fying non-diabetic subjects with IGT but normal fasting glucose.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
In our study isolated IGT occurred in 71% of subjects with IGR.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Because of the small number of deaths we could not report separately the risk of death from all causes and CVD in the three IGR glucose categories.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
In summary post-challenge glucose was a graded and independent predictor of all-cause and CVD mortality among subjects without previously diagnosed diabetes in Asian (Japanese and Asian Indian) ethnic groups.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
While the OGTT is obviously needed to diagnose unrecognised diabetes and IGT it is not ideal for screening purposes because it is time-consuming.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
"Several risk scores [49,50,51,52,53] have been developed to identify individuals at high risk of having undiagnosed diabetes but while the sensitivity and specificity of these risk scores may be stable between countries if applied to the same ethnic group they are unlikely to perform equally well for different ethnic groups [54].",Nakagami_2004.txt,0
Against this background it is clear that the prevention of complications and premature death must start much earlier than the current cut-off points suggested for diabetes.,Nakagami_2004.txt,0
During a long term population based study in a Middle Eastern population we showed that gender significantly modified the impact of silent CAD in different glucose regulation categories for incidence of CVD/ CHD and mortality outcomes.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
The presence of silent CAD independent of traditional risk factors among the female population significantly increased the risk of CVD/CHD incidence for over 2 fold for those with NFG/NGT or pre-diabetes at baseline; among the male population however the risk was significant for CVD/CHD incidents as well as mortality events among the NDM population and marginally significant for NFG/NGT group.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
Importantly in those with NDM the presence of even minor ischemic changes significantly increased the risk to almost 3.5 fold for CVD and total mortality in multivariate sex adjusted analysis respectively.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
The Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS) of patients with type 2 DM revealed no significant association between silent MI and CHD mortality and total mortality which might be due to the lack of statistical power; furthermore they did not find any interaction between sex and MI groups [25].,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study silent and clinical MI increased the risk of CVD events equally in patients with type 2 DM (both had a HR about 4.5) [26].,Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) it was shown that silent MI in the NDM was significantly associated with 31 and 58% increased rates of all-cause mortality and the first fatal MI respectively; however silent MI was not associated with the first non-fatal MI in this group.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
Furthermore although female gender was protective for different events they showed no significant interactions between sex and silent MI [8].,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
In the current study the presence of silent CAD in NDM was significantly associated with 300% increased risk of CVD and more than 250% risk of all-cause mortality among the male population.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
In our previous study it was shown that silent CAD could be a prognostic value for incident CVD/CHD among a male diabetic population including both new diagnosed and drug treated [27].,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
These discrepant results may reflect differences between the selected population in each cohort (i.e. NDM vs. NDM and known DM) differences in CVD risk factors and demographic baseline characteristics length of follow-up and different approaches to analysis of data.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
As we showed among a female Tehranian population with NDM silent CAD did not provide any benefit in risk prediction of different outcomes even in age adjusted analysis.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
"However similar to others we previously showed that NDM among females had higher risk for incident CHD than among males (HR 3.1 vs. 1.7 respectively) [15,28]; the finding that might be attributable to more adverse lipid profile and systemic inflammatory markers among women than in men [29].",Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
Therefore since among female NDM per se is a powerful predictor for incidence of CVD/CHD and mortality compared to males it was hypothesized that diagnosis of the silent CAD among NDM female population provides no additional information regarding different outcomes.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Furthermore the  lack of association between silent CAD among the NDM female population with different outcomes might be attributable to lower rates of events leading to wide confidence intervals for non-significant HRs.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Importantly for the first time we demonstrated the importance of minor ischemic changes in ECG among NDM by showing significant increased risk of CVD/CHD in gender and other risk factor adjusted analysis.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
In the current study we observed no significant difference in prevalence of silent CAD among females with different categories of glucose regulation.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Lundblad et al. however showed that previously unknown Q wave MI was considerably higher among women with IGT than in those with NGT [30].,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Among non-diabetic women we observed that silent CAD had more than 2 fold increased risk for CVD/CHD independent of traditional risk factors.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
In a cross-sectional study of non-diabetic and diabetic men and women it was shown that non-diabetic women tended to have more favorable risk factors and were less insulin resistant than non-diabetic men but this was diminished in the diabetic state.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
"Hence as acknowledged by Wannamethee S.G. et al. [31] ""as women go from non-diabetes to diabetes they need to \travel\ to a more adverse risk profile i.e. they need to put on more weight and deteriorate their insulin sensitivity and related risk factors to a more extent than do men"".",Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
These findings could highlight the presence of silent CAD as a stronger predictor of CVD/CHD in non-diabetic women compared to male population in which higher risk profile might hide the presence of silent CAD as a significant risk factor.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Recently we also demonstrated that in a general population in females with intermediate Framingham risk ECG abnormalities were associated with increased risk of developing CHD and addition of the ECG abnormalities to the Framingham risk assessment improved the classification of CHD risk [32].,Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
Hence regarding high prevalence and importance of silent CAD among a non-diabetic female population we suggest that screening of ECG abnormalities among non-diabetic female might be more important than among diabetic ones.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Regarding male population the prevalence of silent CAD among non-diabetic men was lower than NDM; however the presence of silent CAD among this group increased the risk of all-cause mortality events about 63% which was marginally significant.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Intzilakis et al. emphasized that the presence of IFG and silent myocardial ischemia indicates an increased risk of death or myocardial infarction (HR: 2.5) compared with NFG subjects with no silent myocardial ischemia; however since they did not apply OGTT to exclude the diabetic population the probability of misclassification among the study population should be considered [10].],Hadaegh_2015.txt,1
[Some limitations of this study need to be mentioned.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
First data regarding use of medication and serum electrolytes which might affect ECG abnormalities were not available.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Second our study was conducted in a population aged ≥ 50 years residents of Tehran; thus we cannot generalize the findings to other age groups or to the whole country.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Third we defined glucose categories using OGTT once as applied in other epidemiological studies and this might lead to misclassification among glucose categories.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Among the 978 NFG/NGT population 363 had incident pre-diabetes and 37 of NFG/NGT population developed DM during the follow-up and among the 560 pre-diabetes population 172 cases developed DM and vice versa we found that among the 560 pre-diabetes population 144 cases regressed to NFG/NGT.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
However most other studies [33][34][35] also used only baseline glucose values except for one study [36] that excluded incident diabetes.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Fourth regarding TLGS protocol HbA1c measurement is not performed for participants; hence it was not possible to control the level of HbA1C in our data analysis.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Last but not the least in different categories of glucose regulation we did not examine the added value of ECG abnormalities to traditional risk factors in risk prediction of incident CVD.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
The strengths of our study include its large sample size and using both FPG and 2 h-PLG for determining categories of glucose regulation and assessing better discrimination of CVD outcomes in different categories.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Furthermore regarding the importance of gender in the association of different glucose regulations with incident CVD our data was separately analyzed for both genders.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
This longitudinal study determined the association between IFG and diabetes and all-cause mortality over a 10-year period in Australian women.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Individuals with diabetes were older and had higher indices of adiposity serum triglycerides serum LDL cholesterol blood pressure alcohol consumption and more physical inactivity compared to the other groups.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
The diabetes group also had lower serum HDL cholesterol compared with the IFG and normoglycaemia groups.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
All-cause mortality was greater in those with diabetes whereas we did not detect a difference in the mortality risk for IFG compared to the normoglycaemia group.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
In addition smoking and age were independent predictors of all-cause mortality in the final adjusted model.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
"We found that older age entry at cohort was associated with a reduced allcause mortality which may be explained by a ""healthier participant bias"" [28].",de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Individuals in older age groups who were alive and agreed to participate in our study at baseline were likely to be healthier than those who declined to participate.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
This may have created a bias for mortality in the older age group.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
This study also showed that the association between diabetes and mortality was independent of metabolic syndrome.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
This reinforces the importance a tight glycaemia control and that elevated FPG in the diabetes range increases the risk of mortality [29].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Recent data from the United States [30] indicates that mortality attributed to diabetes is up to three times higher than death certificate data would suggest with many cases of diabetes-related mortality being classified as cardiovascular disease renal failure or sepsis leading to an underestimate of the contribution of diabetes to all-cause mortality.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
There have been many studies investigating the association of IFG with mortality which have been collated in a meta-analysis which included 26 articles [31].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Using ADA criteria for IFG the meta-analysis reported that IFG was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to normoglycaemia (RR 1.07 95% CI similar to our results.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
Other additional studies did not find any association between IFG and mortality risk [19][20][21].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Among US participants aged 52-75 years followed for 6.3 years there was no association between IFG (ADA criteria) and all-cause (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.70-1.24) [19].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
Two additional US studies with follow-up periods of 7.5 [1] and 13 years [21] and a Finnish study with 13 years of follow-up did not demonstrate an association between IFG and all-cause mortality [20].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Other studies have reported an association between IFG and mortality.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
For example a prospective study of 2641 middle-aged men from Eastern Finland followed over 19 years showed that IFG was a risk factor for all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) 1.31 (95% CI) (1.11-2.87)) [2].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
Our study had a similar follow-up time; however we did not show an association between IFG and all-cause mortality.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
One reason for this may be due to sample size; the Finnish study had more participants who could have their FPG followed.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Although that study did not report the RR of FPG for allcause mortality they did show that there was a 10% increase in risk of sudden cardiac death with a 1.0 mmol/L increase in FPG (RR 1.10 (95% CI) 1.04-1.20 p = 0 001).,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Other important differences may be the longer duration of the Finnish study compared to our study and that we included only women whereas the Finnish study included only men.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
By contrast many studies have shown a clear association between diabetes and all-cause mortality.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
A study including data from 22 European cohorts investigated the association between diabetes (FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L) and all-cause mortality.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
Diabetes was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality across an 11-year follow-up; data combined from all 22 cohorts resulted in a HR of 1.6 (95% CI 1.4-1.8) similar to our estimate (HR 1.8 95% CI 1.26-2.7) [32].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
"Some studies have investigated all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes patients and consistently reported that individuals with diabetes have a higher risk of all-cause mortality similar to our results [33,34].",de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Saydah et al. have also estimated that diabetes is responsible for 3.6% of all deaths in Americans adults [35].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Diabetes often develops in the context of a westernised lifestyle poor diet and low-physical activity leading to increased obesity levels and eventually beta-cell failure and diabetes.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
Additionally systemic inflammation hypertension and dyslipidaemia occur simultaneously which leads to cardiovascular disease and increased risk of mortality [29].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
In our study we observed many of these lifestyle and physiological risk factors including lower physical activity and higher levels of obesity in women with diabetes compared to both IFG and normoglycaemia.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Women with diabetes also had higher levels of hypertension and dyslipidaemia; 51.5% 77.9% and 25.0% had triglycerides HDL and LDL respectively outside the recommended range.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Our study has some strengths and limitations.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
A major strength is that the participants were randomly selected and thus are representative of the general population.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Our study also included a wide age range with considerable follow-up time.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
We also used a robust method for diabetes diagnosis which combined a FPG measurement self-report and medication use.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
The study also utilised densitometry for the assessment of body fat mass and lean mass which more accurately assesses body composition estimated from anthropometric measurements [36].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Another strength of this study was complete ascertainment of mortality that was identified through the Death Index.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
However we acknowledge that there are some limitations to our study.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
The majority of the participants were white females and our results may not be generalisable to other populations.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
The women who participated at baseline but who were excluded from the study due to insufficient information to classify diabetes status differed from those who were included in the study on factors that might have predisposed them to impaired fasting glucose or diabetes.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Another limitation of the study was that diabetes status categorised based on a single FPG whereas international guidelines require an elevated fasting glucose on at least two occasions.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,1
Furthermore we did not have information on specific causes of mortality.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Finally we did rely on some self-reported data such as medication use smoking alcohol consumption and physical activity which may not be accurate but it is important to note that most of our analyses were based on biochemical and clinical measurements as well as mortality data from the National Death Index.],de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
[In this study we report that diabetes was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality; however there was no difference detected in risk between women with IFG and women with normoglycaemia over 10 years of follow-up.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
We also showed that mortality in Australian women with diabetes continues to be elevated indicating that secondary prevention measures have not been effective at reducing premature mortality in this group.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
Given that we did not find an association between IFG and all-cause mortality women with IFG are a valuable target for prevention of premature mortality associated with diabetes.,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0
The prevalence of MetS ranged from 18.8% based on the EGIR definition to 21.9% for the IDF definition.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
As many as 31.3% had MetS by any definition while only 10.7% fulfilled all three definitions criteria.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
Hence the identified risk groups were quite different for the three definitions used.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
The associated  17) 139 ( 19) 150 ( 18) 139 ( 19) 148 ( 18) Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 86 ( 9) 91 ( 9) 86 ( 9) 92 ( 9) 86 ( 9  risk for fatal and non-fatal CVD was also very different.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
For the NCEP-ATPIII definition the risk of CVD remained significant after adjustments for several confounding factors while the new IDF definition was not associated with any increased cardiovascular risk after these adjustments.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
The results suggest that the cut-off for waist circumference used in the IDF definition may be too low in this Caucasian population in spite of the fact that it is by itself a well-documented risk factor [35].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
In a similar study based on 3589 elderly British women [19] it was concluded that MetS defined by any of the three (WHO NCEP-ATPIII and IDF) is only modestly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
The authors suggested that life-course socio-economic position appeared to be an important confounder in the association of MetS with CHD risk [19].,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
In the present study however adjustments for educational achievement had very small effects on the relationships between MetS and CVD regardless of which definition was used.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
The results were virtually unchanged after further adjustments for occupation (data not shown).,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
There are important differences between the two studies e.g. with respect to populations and end-point definitions that could possibly explain the different results.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
In our study both men and women of younger age groups were included thus making the results more easy to generalize for middle-aged subjects of both sexes but we could not adjust for social characteristics over the life course [19] because of lack of data.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
In another paper the NCEP-ATPIII definition of MetS was superior to the IDF definition for prediction of vascular events in 750 patients with established coronary artery disease [36] but this study was not population based.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
Correspondingly in a study of 20 789 well-educated (75% college graduates) non-Hispanic white American males visiting a health screening clinic the long-term prediction of total and CVD mortality was equal by use of the IDF and NCEP-ATPIII defi-nitions of MetS but differed according to waist circumference cathegory [37].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
Recently the DECODE study published data to support the use of the WHO definition for prediction of CVD mortality particularly in men [22].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
One aspect of the diagnostic procedure in general is labelling.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
This may interfere with the quality of life in subjectively healthy people living with a number of risk factors.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
However it may also be seen as an alarm signal for the need of lifestyle  improvement.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
Ideally improved eating habits and physical exercise as well as smoking cessation should be the expected consequence of this diagnostic procedure.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
However if too many people are labelled with a diagnosis of MetS this may lead to great difficulties for the health-care system to handle this large number of patients as resources are always limited.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
Therefore a diagnosis of MetS should be used in order to find high-risk individuals to motivate for lifestyle changes not to label low-risk individuals.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
It might therefore be questioned according to the most recent definition by IDF from 2005 [11] in spite of good intentions whether the cut-off for waist circumference the purpose of identifying high-risk individuals for CVD is accurate or not.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
In itself without concomitant risk factors obesity is a rather weak cardiovascular risk and the same is true for triglyceridaemia alone as previously shown in the Malmö data [38].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
However elevated blood pressure seems to be a stronger risk factor [39].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
Quite a different ambition is to use different definitions of MetS to target risk individuals for the development of Type 2 diabetes [40].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
Even if this is similar to finding risk individuals for CVD the target groups are not completely identical.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
The different MetS definitions should therefore also be compared for prediction of Type 2 diabetes in a similar way as for the prediction of CVD.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
Many studies have reported that established Type 2 diabetes is a stronger CVD risk factor in women with about 50% higher relative risk in women than in men with diabetes [41].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
MetS is a risk factor for diabetes and could be regarded as a precursor of established diabetes.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
It is therefore noteworthy that men and women with MetS had largely the same relative risk of CVD in this study with overlapping confidence intervals between genders.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
However this study was restricted to non-diabetic subjects.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
With a few exceptions HRs for full definitions of the syndrome were not significantly different from those for their single components (Table 6) as in the DECODE study for prediction of CVD mortality [22].,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
It should however be kept in mind that for example smoking is not a component of the metabolic syndrome by any definition in spite of its highly predictive value for CVD risk and therefore some comparisons of single risk factors or clusters of risk factors for prediction might be unbalanced.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
],Nilsson_2007.txt,0
[Although the MDC is a large prospective cohort study our attendance rate was only 40% [23].,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
The recruitment of more healthy subjects (selection bias) would however most likely decrease not increase the predictive power for total CVD events.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
Therefore we do not think that we have exaggerated our findings.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
As we only used measurements of variables at one single examination this may dilute the precision of defining MetS.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
Ideally we should have used multiple measurements of for example blood pressure and blood glucose.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
However it can be assumed that this effect on the prevalence of MetS was similar for all definitions.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
Another limitation is that we have no information on possible treatment effects in this cohort as it could be expected that a substantial number of risk subjects were offered treatment following screening.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
However if such preventive treatment was offered it would dilute our findings of risk prediction not strengthen them.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
It has also been argued that the criteria for MetS should be used not as fixed characteristics but as continuous variable [42]; however we did not do this analysis.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
Finally we did not have information about proinsulin or inflammatory markers other than CRP which could be useful in order to further explore the nature of the relationships between MetS and CVD as shown for proinsulin in another Swedish study [43].,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
The number of events in women was low in comparison with men thus the statistical power to make comparisons between genders is currently too weak.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
However our study was based on a large cohort of both men and women followed for 11 years for prediction of both fatal and non-fatal events.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
We were also able to adjust for CRP levels in relation to MetS and CVD risk which has not often been carried out previously.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
In conclusion the new IDF 2005 definition of the metabolic syndrome resulted in a higher prevalence rate (labelling) of MetS than previous definitions (NCEP-ATPIII EGIR) but was not superior for prediction of total cardiovascular events.,Nilsson_2007.txt,1
This was true for both genders and questions the usefulness of the IDF criteria in a North-European Caucasian population if cardiovascular risk prediction based on MetS is the main goal.,Nilsson_2007.txt,0
This was a longitudinal study with a large sample size and longterm follow-up period which enabled us to investigate the relationship between several fasting serum glucose levels and the incident risk of CHD in men and women.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
The relative risks of CHD in women increased from a prediabetic range (!110 mg/dL) whereas those in men increased at a diabetic range (!126 mg/dL).,Ahn_2018.txt,1
Women had higher HRs for CHD than men and differences in HRs between men and women were statistically significant.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
"Previous studies have reported that the relative risk of cardiovascular disease increases more in women than in men [9,10,19,20].",Ahn_2018.txt,0
Our findings are in agreement with the results of previous studies that showed that the diabetic range of fasting serum glucose was associated with a more significant CHD risk in women than in men after adjusting for major cardiovascular risk factors.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Moreover the interesting aspect of our study is that the prediabetic range of fasting serum glucose was associated with CHD only in women.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Few studies have investigated the sex difference on the CHD risk in association with hyperglycemia lower than the diabetic range.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
The Framingham study reported that the incidence of cardiovascular disease was positively associated with casual blood glucose levels in nondiabetic women whereas such an association was not observed in men [21].,Ahn_2018.txt,0
A prospective study reported that asymptomatic hyperglycemia defined as the top 5% of the casual blood glucose distribution (!126 mg/dL) was a significant risk factor for mortality due to CHD in women but not in men [22].,Ahn_2018.txt,1
The Hoorn study which examined the association between the continuous blood glucose concentration and cardiovascular disease mortality showed no clear consistent differences between men and women [23].,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Differences in the glucose assay methods endpoint measurements and small number of events in the previous studies may have contributed to these inconsistencies.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
"""The reason why hyperglycemia has a greater relative risk for CHD in women than in men is unclear.",Ahn_2018.txt,0
Several mechanisms may explain why hyperglycemia has a greater adverse effect in women than in men.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Hyperglycemia may have a stronger additive or synergistic effect on overweight hypertension hypercholesterolemia and smoking in women than in men.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
A previous study reported that the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic women can be mediated in part by the loss of a womans usually favorable lipoprotein profile in the presence of diabetes [24].,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Our studys results corroborate these explanations because they showed that differences in the baseline levels of the body mass index systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol level among participants with and without diabetes were significantly greater in women than in men (Supplementary Table 1).,Ahn_2018.txt,0
These findings were also consistent with those of a previous study which reported that differences in the levels of blood pressure and lipids between individuals with and without diabetes were significantly Fig. 2. Survival probability from coronary heart disease events according to baseline fasting serum glucose levels and sex during the 11-year follow-up.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Normoglycemic baseline fasting serum glucose level <100 mg/dL; impaired fasting glucose (IFG) 100 mg/dL baseline fasting serum glucose level <126 mg/dL; diabetic baseline fasting serum glucose level !126 mg/dL.,Ahn_2018.txt,1
Values for p denote the results of the log-rank test for sex differences for each fasting serum glucose level.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
greater in women than in men [25].,Ahn_2018.txt,0
This would potentially explain why the attenuation of HRs for CHD was considerably greater in women than in men after multivariable adjustment.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
"The sex difference in the CHD risk related to the fasting serum glucose level may be mediated in part by differences in the levels of other cardiovascular risk factors [26,27].",Ahn_2018.txt,0
Another possible explanation for the sex difference in the effect of diabetes on the CHD risk is the persistently more favorable survival rate for women without diabetes than for men without diabetes [20].,Ahn_2018.txt,0
In the present study there was a marked male predominance in the CHD incidence among participants with nondiabetic glucose levels whereas the gap between men and women was almost eliminated among participants with diabetic fasting glucose levels (Fig. 1).,Ahn_2018.txt,0
In addition previous studies have indicated that the greater risk of CHD associated with diabetes in women may indicate a treatment bias that favors men [28][29][30][31][32].,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Men with diabetes or a history of cardiovascular disease are more likely to receive aspirin statins or antihypertensive drugs than women do.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
"The excess relative risk of CHD in women with diabetes may be due to the more aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in men with diabetes than in women with diabetes.""",Ahn_2018.txt,0
Several possible limitations of the present study should be considered.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
First there was no objective information on antidiabetic medications for this study population.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Thus individuals who indicated that they had any previously diagnosed disease were excluded.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Second an oral glucose tolerance test was not performed in the current study and insulin levels were not measured.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Although the 2-hour glucose tolerance test is a better predictor for cardiovascular mortality than the fasting glucose test [33] the fasting serum glucose test is recommended for use in mass screening as it is easier and faster to perform more convenient and less expensive.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Third the accuracy of diagnoses from health insurance claims data and death certificates may be considered.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
A previous study analyzing validity of diagnosis in Korean national health insurance claims data has reported that the accuracy for diagnosing acute MI was more than 70% [34].,Ahn_2018.txt,0
Fourth the present study was performed in only middle-aged Korean men and women which may limit the generalizability of our results to other populations.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
In conclusion women had a higher hazard ratio of CHD associated with fasting serum glucose than men.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
The stronger effect of fasting serum glucose levels on the CHD risk in women was significant from a prediabetic range (!110 mg/dL).,Ahn_2018.txt,0
These findings suggest that more careful glycemic control may be needed in women with hyperglycemia to prevent CHD.,Ahn_2018.txt,0
This study demonstrates for an older population that subjects with undiagnosed diabetes have a similar all-cause mortality risk as subjects with previously known diabetes and that all-cause mortality in persons with undiagnosed or known diabetes is strongly increased compared with persons with prediabetes and NGT.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
Undiagnosed diabetes in older patients is also associated with cancer mortality but not with cardiovascular mortality.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
Furthermore mortality is also increased in subjects with very low levels of glycemia as indicated by values of HbAlc FPG or 2hPG in the lowest decile.],Kowall_2011.txt,0
[The KORA S4 study is one of the few studies on all-cause mortality in different glucose tolerance categories focusing on older subjects.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
In the Edinburgh Artery Study cohort with a study population in the same age range (i.e. 55-74 years) HR for known diabetes (1.75; 95%CI 1.15-2.67) was only slightly larger than that for newly detected diabetes (1.60; 95%CI 1.20-2.13) after adjustment for age and sex [6].,Kowall_2011.txt,0
"In the Asturias and the DECODE studies both including participants of middle and old ages similar mortality risks were also found for known and undiagnosed diabetes [4,5].",Kowall_2011.txt,0
By contrast mortality risks in the AusDiab study were higher for known diabetes than for previously undiagnosed diabetes [26].,Kowall_2011.txt,0
Whether subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes should be expected to have a similar mortality risk as subjects with known diabetes -as our study suggests -may depend on several factors.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
One factor is the profile of metabolic and lifestyle risk factors at baseline.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
The comparison of risk factors in subjects with previously undiagnosed diabetes and subjects with previously known diabetes was ambiguous.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
Subjects with previously undiagnosed diabetes showed a better profile in some regards (lower BMI lower waist circumference lower glucose levels more HDL cholesterol) but smoking and high alcohol consumption was less common in persons with known diabetes.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
However the hazard ratios of both groups compared with NGT were nearly identical after adjustment for metabolic and lifestyle factors.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
A second factor is the duration of diabetes since onset.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
Subjects with known diabetes had been diagnosed with the disease about 7 years before the baseline investigation so they were very likely to have diabetes for a much longer time than subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
A third factor that may affect all-cause mortality is the different treatment of diabetes in the two groups.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
In our study the subjects with newly detected diabetes had received their diagnosis at baseline.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
However we have only limited information about their subsequent diabetes treatment:,Kowall_2011.txt,0
In a subgroup of 47 subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes about two thirds of them stated that they had seen their general practitioners for potential retesting.,Kowall_2011.txt,0

This finding is in line with the Spanish Asturias Study where only 60% of the with previously undiagnosed diabetes actually informed their treating physicians about their new diagnosis [4].,Kowall_2011.txt,0
An additional factor related to diabetes treatment refers to potential differences in health consciousness.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
It might be assumed that subjects with undiagnosed diabetes are less health-conscious and participate less often in medical checkups than those with known diabetes.],Kowall_2011.txt,0
"[In the present study a strong increase in cancer mortality risk was found in subjects with undiagnosed diabetes which is in line with results of the DECODE study but contrary to those of the NHANES II study [12,13].",Kowall_2011.txt,0
In the KORA study the association between undiagnosed diabetes and cancer mortality can most likely not be explained by reverse causality (i.e. pancreas cancer causing diabetes) or by subclinical or undiagnosed cancer at baseline because the association was still significant after excluding the cases of cancer deaths occurring in the first 3 years after baseline investigation.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
Furthermore the higher cancer mortality in undiagnosed diabetes cannot be ascribed to risk factors common in subjects with diabetes because undiagnosed diabetes was still associated with cancer mortality after multi variable adjustment.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
Our study results of the analysis of the cardiovascular death risk showed a significant association with known diabetes but not with newly diagnosed diabetes.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
However this result might have been due to the low study power due to the small number of subjects who died of cardiovascular diseases (only six of the subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes).,Kowall_2011.txt,0
In the NHANES II study the risk of cardiovascular mortality was smaller in undiagnosed diabetes than in diagnosed diabetes as seen by the HRs of 1.54 (95%CI 0.85-2.79) and 2.62 (95%CI 1.81-3.78) respectively [8].,Kowall_2011.txt,0

The present study adds to the literature by assessing mortality rates among individuals with intermediate hyperglycaemia using population-based data.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
The prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia according to the three studied definitions varied from 5.9% to 38.5%.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
The study also found that individuals with HbA 1c levels between 39 and 46 mmol/mol (5.7 and 6.4%) had a higher rate of mortality in comparison to people with HbA 1c levels < 39 mmol/mol (5.7%) in this cohort from Peru at 10-year follow-up.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
The IEC HbA 1cbased definition was associated with an increased risk of mortality although this was not statistically significant.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
There was no evidence of an association between the ADA IFG-based definition of intermediate hyperglycaemia and mortality but such an observation was observed when using the ADA HbA 1c -based definition although participants with intermediate hyperglycaemia according to the latter definition did have a somewhat more favourable cardiometabolic risk profile especially with regard to obesity.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
Our findings differ from those of a systematic review and meta-analysis by Huang et al. [5] who reported that intermediate hyperglycaemia defined by fasting glucose level was associated with all cause-mortality but they did not find an association using the HbA 1c definitions [5].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
Similar to our results however a previous systematic review by the same author group [15] as well as a study from Taiwan [6] reported no association between intermediate hyperglycaemia assessed using the ADA IFG-based definition and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes mortality.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
It is important to mention that in the recent systematic review [5] only the studies conducted in the Netherlands and Finland and not in other countries reported a strong association between ADA IFG-defined intermediate hyperglycaemia and all-cause mortality.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
In addition only studies from the USA Asia Europe and Australia were included in the systematic review and it did not include for example individuals with different sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics from those living in Latin America.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Genetics might play a role in the difference among findings worldwide: the admixture among Peruvians is very high with many groups sharing common Native American ancestry [16] whereas the European ancestry component is relatively small (<10%) [17].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
The correlation between glucose and HbA 1c levels might also play a role in the differences between the findings of the present study when compared to those of the previous systematic reviews as these variables are affected by factors such as high altitude [18] environmental temperature [19] or the characteristics of the tests themselves [20].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
In addition high altitude could explain the fact that the HRs for the associations between both intermediate hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes with mortality were higher in the rural population in comparison to the rural-to-urban migrant and urban populations; a previous study in Peru found that 53 mmol/mol (6.5%) of HbA 1c was correlated to glucose levels of 6.6. mmol/l at sea levels and 14.8 mmol/ l at high altitude.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Furthermore in India a lower HbA 1c threshold has been used to define diabetes [45 mmol/mol (6.3%)] based on the glucose torelance test [21] which highlights the fact that some participants in the present study might have been misclassified as having intermediate hyperglycaemia using HbA 1c  when in reality they have type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
As mentioned in the introduction the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and all-cause mortality is well known; however the estimations of the associations in the present study (HRs of 2.92-5.30 according to the different definitions) are higher in comparison to those in previous studies.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
The relatively recent systematic review of all-cause mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes in Latin America found a relative risk of between 2.26 (95% CI 1.36-3.74) and 2.49 (95% CI 1.96-3.15) using a composite definition and self-reported diagnosis respectively [7].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
The highest association observed in the systematic review was an HR of 6.64 (95% CI 1.94-22.8) in a cohort in Brazil with 13 years of follow-up [22] and another high value was the HR of 4.38 (95% CI 3.43-5.59) reported in a cohort in Mexico with a 15-year follow-up [23].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
These are greater than the associations of mortality and type 2 diabetes found in Sweden (adjusted HR 1.15 95% CI 1.14-1.16) in a cohort with a 4-year follow-up [4] and in England (adjusted HR 2.19 95% CI 2.16-2.21) in a cohort followed for 17 years [24].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
The differences between high-income countries and countries in Latin America may be the result of disparities in access to healthcare insurance coverage and the quality of healthcare received between such countries [25].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
The findings of the present study are relevant as individuals with HbA 1c between 39 and 46 mmol/mol (5.7% and 6.4%) had higher mortality than those with normal HbA 1c levels showing that the former probably require special management to prevent negative outcomes.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
However a systematic review including individuals with intermediate hyperglycaemia found that screening and treatment strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus had limitations because even if both short-(6 months) and long-term (up to 7 years) interventions delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes many individuals might have been incorrectly classified as having intermediate hyperglycaemia [26].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
Nowadays lifestyle interventions are the standard of care for impaired glucose tolerance [27] but there is limited evidence for these in the management of IFG or intermediate hyperglycaemia defined according to HbA 1c levels.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
"Moreover the management of intermediate hyperglycaemia with drugs is still controversial in terms of efficacy and cost [28,29].",Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
"Finally previous studies have found that the prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia increases four times using the ADA definitions (based on IFG and/or HbA 1c ) [6,30] which could imply a huge challenge to health systems.",Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
Similarly another study in Peruvian population found that the magnitude of regression to normal glucose/HbA 1c levels was much higher than progression towards type 2 diabetes after 2.5 years of follow-up [31].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
So even if we know that the ADA HbA 1c -based definition of intermediate hyperglycaemia is associated with a high mortality rate the available evidence is not clear on how to manage this risk to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes and/or mortality.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
To date nearly all efforts to synthesize the evidence regarding intermediate hyperglycaemia have concentrated on high-income countries.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
In the present study we show that intermediate hyperglycaemia using the ADA HbA 1c -based definition may be important for estimating the rate of mortality in resource-constrained settings contributing to the knowledge in this area in a poorly studied population.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
The study has some limitations that should be noted.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
First all-cause mortality was used as the outcome because information about cause of death was not available using the RENIEC records.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Second a potential time gap between the date of death and its registration in RENIEC is possible and which could have led us to underestimate the incidence of death in our population.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Additionally the factors identified as associated with mortality (Table S3) were not adjusted for confounders.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Third we could not include the WHO definition of IFG [FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l (110-125 mg/dl)] because we did not have cases with that definition in our sample.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
Fourth an oral glucose tolerance test was not performed at baseline for logistical and budget reasons.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
However we based our definition on the use of fasting glucose and HbA 1c as in previous studies.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
Fifth our study population was not nationally representative; however it included different population groups (rural rural-to-urban migrants and urban) from specific areas of Peru.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Finally HbA 1c is usually a specific measurement by which to diagnose and monitor diabetes but other conditions could increase HbA 1c levels such as iron deficiency anaemia a condition that might be more common in rural areas or in people of low socioeconomic status.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Additionally other less common conditions in Peru could affect HbA 1c levels such as kidney failure liver disease sickle cell disease and thalassaemia [9].,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
In conclusion intermediate hyperglycaemia using the ADA HbA 1c -based definition was associated with an increased mortality rate in cohort from Peru with a 10-year follow-up.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,1
HbA 1c would appear to be a variable associated with mortality in this Peruvian population.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
Further research is needed however on how to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes and/or mortality in this population.],Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
[The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of [INSTITUTION] and informed consent was obtained from all participants.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
This research study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.,Lazo-Porras_2020.txt,0
In this study the HbA 1c level was a significant predictor of mortality.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Individuals with NGT but with HbA 1c at 6.5% or above and at high risk of diabetes had substantially increased all-cause mortality.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
"Although due to the low number of individuals with HbA 1c at 6.5% or above our results are subject to some uncertainty they do support previous findings of chronic hyperglycaemia being harmful [5,13,14] and also stress the significance of HbA 1c levels in the identification of risk groups.",Skriver_2010.txt,0
Carotid intima-media thickness is a well-established index of early atherosclerosis and is widely used as surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease [15].,Skriver_2010.txt,0
A recent study found an independent relationship between HbA 1c and carotid intima-media thickness in individuals with NGT [16] although the former only contributed 4.4% to the variation of the latter.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
The authors suggest that glycaemic control might have a pathophysiological relevance in the development of atherosclerosis even in individuals with NGT.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
It is not known whether cardiovascular disease is the main reason for the increased all-cause mortality in the present study.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
An international expert committee recently suggested use of HbA 1c as a diagnostic test for diabetes [17].,Skriver_2010.txt,0
In the present study we found that individuals with NGT and HbA 1c at 6.5% or above have the same mortality as individuals with screen-detected type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
This supports the proposed use of HbA 1c at 6.5% or above as the threshold for diabetes when considering individuals who have NGT yet are at high risk of diabetes.,Skriver_2010.txt,1
One strength of this study is that all individuals with HbA 1c at 6.0% or above had FBG measured and almost all had an OGTT (55 individuals with HbA 1c between 6.0 and 6.5% and one with HbA 1c above 6.5% had no OGTT performed.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
All of these 56 individuals had FBG below 5.6 mmol/l) ensuring that individuals categorised as NGT and with HbA 1c at 6.0% or above did not have dysglycaemia at screening.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
"Other strengths are that this study was large involving 15,634 individuals with NGT and at high risk of diabetes and that the screening process was in accordance with a stepwise high-risk strategy as recommended by international organisations as well as by health authorities in certain countries.",Skriver_2010.txt,0
"Follow-up moreover was complete an achievement made possible by the unique personal Danish identification code and our access to record linkage with major national registries of vital status emigration and hospitalisations [18,19].",Skriver_2010.txt,0
All measurements of BP height and weight were standardised.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Glucose was Fig. 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for all-cause mortality.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Light grey line low risk; medium grey line NGT HbA 1c <6.0%; dark grey line NGT HbA 1c 6.0-to <6.5%; black line type 2 diabetes; dashed line NGT HbA 1c ≥6.5%  -413 (30.1) FBG (mmol/l) 4.9 measured locally by the GP but using standardised equipment quality control procedures and duplicate measurements that minimise measurement error to a level where the quality is comparable to that achieved in centralised laboratories [20].,Skriver_2010.txt,1
HbA 1c analyses were done in one of two centralised laboratories.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
A main limitation of the study is the small number of individuals with NGT and HbA 1c at 6.5% or above.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Because of the small sample size in this group the results are subject to some uncertainty.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Another limitation is that people at high risk of diabetes and with HbA 1c below 5.8% and random blood glucose below 5.5 mmol/l did not have FBG measured or an OGTT performed; neither was an OGTT performed in individuals with HbA 1c below 5.8% and FBG below 5.6 mmol/l.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Therefore we do not know whether some of those categorised as NGT with HbA 1c below 5.8% actually had some kind of dysglycaemia.,Skriver_2010.txt,1
If that were the case then we have included individuals with dysglycaemia in the group of NGT individuals with HbA 1c below 6.0%.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
People with dysglycaemia are expected to have higher mortality than those with NGT and thereby the true mortality among NGT individuals with HbA 1c below 6.0% might be lower than that reported here.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
However we expect the number of misclassified individuals to be very small.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
HbA 1c was measured centrally (and hence uniformly) while systolic BP was measured by the different GPs.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Consequently the effect of HbA 1c might be overestimated while the effect of systolic BP might be underestimated.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Since all GPs were expected to follow the guidelines for good clinical practice when measuring systolic BP we expect this bias to be small.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Smoking was assessed entirely on the basis of self-reported data.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
This might cause a misclassification of smoking status.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Such a misclassification is most likely to have occurred randomly with regard to HbA 1c level glucose tolerance status and mortality.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
We have no information on lifestyle changes pharmacological treatment progression from NGT to type 2 diabetes mellitus or some other form of dysglycaemia or on any changes in the included variables during follow-up.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
These considerations however are of great importance when investigating why people with NGT but at high risk of diabetes and with raised HbA 1c have high all-cause mortality.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
The ADDITION study [9] focuses on people found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Due to initiation of lifestyle changes and pharmacological treatment we did not include information on HbA 1c for individuals found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Thus this study does not determine whether HbA 1c is a predictor of mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Approximately half of the individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus in this study are enrolled in the intensive pharmacological intervention arm of the ADDITION study and we expect that almost all individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus will have received some kind of treatment during follow-up.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
This will probably have influenced their survival .,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Relevant results from the ADDITION study will be published in 2010.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
"The proportion of individuals with HbA 1c at 6.5% or above among individuals with NGT was low (in a total study population of 15,634 individuals with NGT and at high risk of diabetes we found 68 individuals with HbA 1c at 6.5% or above).",Skriver_2010.txt,1
In the present study measurement of HbA 1c was an integrated part of a step-wise screening programme for type 2 diabetes mellitus for which reason identification of individuals with NGT and HbA 1c at 6.5% or above introduced no extra cost.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
Henceforth when deciding whether to include HbA 1c in the identification of individuals with high mortality economic considerations and clinical utility will have to be taken into account.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
This study adds new and important information to consider when deciding on guidance and potential treatment of individuals at high risk of diabetes who are enrolled in targeted stepwise screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus and found to have NGT.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
In short HbA 1c had a prognostic value for all-cause mortality in individuals at high risk of diabetes but with NGT.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
For individuals with HbA 1c at 6.5% or above the mortality was just as high as for individuals with treated screen-detected type 2 diabetes mellitus although the sample sizes are small and these findings may be due to chance or underlying confounding factors that we have not accounted for.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
If the association is causal we urge added awareness of individuals at high risk of diabetes and identified as having NGT during targeted screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Skriver_2010.txt,0
This applies particularly to individuals with HbA 1c at 6.5% or above.,Skriver_2010.txt,0

Both IFG and IGT were fourfold independent determinants of type-2 diabetes in both sexes while the postprandial glucose category 5.6-7.8 mmol/L conferred a 1.8-fold diabetes risk.,Onat_2013.txt,1

Turks possessing largely functionally heterogeneous HDL end up with diabetes along two pathways (Fig. 1): either by low HDL (among participants with normally functioning HDL) yielding IFG-mediated diabetes or by dysfunctional HDL (in relatively high concentrations) leading to diabetes mediated by IGT and low-grade inflammation.,Onat_2013.txt,1

Inflammation in the prediabetic state was shown in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study to be related to increased insulin resistance rather than decreased insulin secretion [27].,Onat_2013.txt,1

Because of the prospective cohort design the baseline measurements of all cohort members were unlikely to be affected by storage and laboratory issues that might be raised in some nested case-control studies.,Chien_2008.txt,0
In addition the use of a community-based population could reduce the possibility of selection bias.,Chien_2008.txt,0
We also included important socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors in the models to control for potential confounding factors.,Chien_2008.txt,0
Our study had several potential limitations.,Chien_2008.txt,0
First the number of incident cases of CVD events was relatively small even with 10.5 years follow-up.,Chien_2008.txt,0
This would reduce the power to detect the subtle differences between various glucose and insulin markers and make some of the RR estimates unstable.,Chien_2008.txt,0
Second because glucose and insulin levels were measured only once our results might be prone to intraindividual variations which might have attenuated our results.,Chien_2008.txt,0
Finally the study results may not be generalizable to other ethnic groups.,Chien_2008.txt,0
In conclusion our data suggest that fasting and postchallenge glucose concentrations are statistically significant independent predictors of CVD risk in a Chinese population.,Chien_2008.txt,0
Our data indicate that postchallenge glucose a measurement of peripheral tissue insulin resistance status should be taken into consideration in assessing CVD risk in Asian populations.,Chien_2008.txt,0
Because of only moderate correlation coefficients between postchallenge glucose and other glucose and insulin resistance markers postchallenge glucose can provide useful information for comprehensive evaluation of CVD risk in Asian populations.,Chien_2008.txt,0
This is the first study to be carried out on an older Middle-Eastern population and the second study in the world to examine the impact of different glucose tolerance categories using strict oral glucose tolerance test criteria in the prediction of CVD and mortality events.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
The present prospective study of elderly Tehranians with a median follow up of >9 years showed that people with KDM were at higher risk of CVD CHD and allcause mortality events.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
Regarding the NDM population only people with the combined IFH and IPH phenotype were at higher risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
The phenotypes of prediabetes status IFH and IPH alone did not show significant risk for CVD and mortality events.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
In the current study we found that approximately 55% (459/459 + 375) of our elderly population showed some degree of abnormality in glucose metabolism (i.e. dysglycemia) including prediabetes status IFH IPH combined IFH&IPH and drug-treated diabetes.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
However the most common phenotype (55%) among the dysglycemic population was prediabetes status (252/ 459); the phenotype that showed no excess risk for CVD and mortality outcomes.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
The present results are in line with those of the Deedwania et al. study in which prediabetes did not provide any risk for the population aged ≥65 years; 9   CHD and total mortality.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
14 However it should be noted that their analysis was not adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0

"""In the present study IPH -the most prevalent phenotype among NDM (51%) -did not show any extra risk neither for CVD nor for total mortality outcomes.",Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1

In addition there are reports of different roles of IPH among the two sexes.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
In the study by Barret-Connor et al. IPH was a significant risk factor for CVD only among women; however the present analysis did not show a significant interaction between sex and different glucose tolerance groups.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
19,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
In the present study the IFH group had the lowest prevalence among the NDM and dysglycemic population (9% and 2% respectively) without making any risk for CVD and total mortality.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
Data regarding the role of IFH on mortality are scarce.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
The Edinburg Artery study of an elderly group showed no significant effect of IFH on CVD and total mortality as well.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
In the DECODE study fasting hyperglycemia was associated with excess risk of CVD mortality among population aged 30-89 years; however the largest number of excess death was shown in those who had impaired glucose tolerance but normal FPG level.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
20,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
This lack of agreement between the DECODE study and present study is probably due to differences in study population characteristics.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
DECODE used data of a population aged 30-89 years rather than an elderly population leading to a difference in prevalence of blood sugar phenotypes in the first place between these two studies.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
This difference of prevalence can be justified by the fact that IPH prevalence increased from 0.7% to 4.6% in the DECODE study itself when the age group changed from <50 years to >70 years.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
21,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
This pattern of prevalence and outcome development of IPH with regard to aging can make an analogy with high blood pressure which is seen to increase in prevalence by aging yet it shows lower risks for outcome development.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
22,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
In the current study the combined IFH & IPH phenotype which constituted almost 40% of our NDM population increased the risks of CHD events CVD and total mortality to almost 2.5- 3.5-and 2.5-fold respectively.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
A potential explanation for the significant effect of combined IFH&IPH in the present study might be due to the independent pathophysiology of these conditions.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
It has been shown that IFH and IPH stem from isolated impaired fasting glucose and isolated impaired glucose tolerance respectively 23 and these two are because of increased hepatic and muscle insulin resistance respectively.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
24 Thus IFH and IPH can play an independent role in developing abnormal glucose metabolisms related events.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
It is also shown that IFH and IPH have different genetic components and variants which is another confirmation for the possibility of independent roles of these conditions.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
25 Among a few cohorts considering different categories of glucose abnormalities among an older population the Edinburg Artery cohort showed considerable increased risk of CVD and total mortality among the combined IFH&IPH phenotype.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0

"17,20",Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
In the present study we found no interaction between the history of CVD and glucose categories for total mortality outcome hence we did not exclude prevalent CVD for all-cause mortality.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
However when we excluded prevalent CVD cases no NDM categories were significant predictors of allcause mortality anymore (data not shown).,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
Other studies that reported a significant role of NDM in predicting all-cause mortality adjusted rather than excluded individuals with prevalent CVD; thus it seems that the significant association of NDM with higher death rates might be debatable among elderly population.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
"18,26",Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
The loss of association between some categories of NDM and all-cause mortality among elderly populations might be due to death from other competing risk factors before development of diabetes complications in their population.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
27 Furthermore another possible explanation might be the different pathophysiology of NDM among the older population.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
28 Regarding KDM our results are consistent with other reports on the significant predictive value of KDM for CVD and total mortality.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
"20,29,30 Similar results have been noted for the role of KDM among older adults.",Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
The present study did have some limitations.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
First we defined different glucose categories based on single FPG and oral glucose tolerance test value which could lead to misclassification between dysglycemic groups.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
Second the low rates of events occurred in different glucose categories especially the IFH and IPH groups which could contribute to some degree of imprecision.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
"Third the present study was carried out among elderly urban residents in Tehran which prevents generalization of findings to other parts of the country.""",Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
To conclude during a long-term follow-up study of elderly Iranians we showed that the prediabetes status had the highest prevalence of dysglycemia phenotype and did not highlight any risk for CVD and mortality events; hence screening of prediabetes status among this group of the population might not be justified.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1
Furthermore we found that screen-detected diabetes limited to those with both IFH and IPH as well as drug-treated diabetes highlighted the significant risk for CVD and total mortality.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,0
Considering the nonsignificant effect of IFH or IPH alone on CVD and all-cause mortality in the current study and the potential adverse effects of intervention related to hypoglycemia in older adults 31 the risk of overtreatment in this group of the population should be considered 32 suggesting that diabetes among older adults should be considered as a separate category.,Mirbolouk_2016.txt,1

Adding a fasting glucose measurement to a lipid profile did not improve the Framingham risk prediction of incident CHD in the Whitehall II cohort over 11 years of follow-up.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The Framingham risk score alone performed best at predicting major coronary events and moderately well at predicting any manifestation of coronary disease.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
We looked for a gain in risk stratification over and above the Framingham risk calculation as a result of adding either fasting glucose as a continuous measure or glycaemic status in three categories-normal glucose tolerance impaired fasting glucose or diabetes.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
Neither approach led to improved discrimination using the area under the curve method.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The expected gain in prediction attributable to newly identified diabetes was evident with fatal CHD ⁄ non-fatal MI as outcome but the net reclassification improvement was modest (2.4%).,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The limited improvement in discriminative ability was obtained by finding individuals with a fasting glucose level in the diabetic range rather than by utilizing fasting glucose in the prediction model.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
Our results thus broadly agree with those from an Australian study using cardiovascular mortality as outcome [13].,Brunner_2010.txt,0
That study found no evidence that fasting glucose added to risk stratification over and above conventional risk factors.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
Our study was based on fasting glucose rather than the random blood sample recommended in the JBS2 guidelines.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The measurements were taken as a part of a quality-controlled study protocol.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
As within-individual variability of a random blood glucose taken under varying circumstances in routine clinical practice can be expected to be higher it is likely that the associations with future CHD in this study were stronger than would be obtained in clinical practice.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The JBS2 guidelines suggest that when a lipid profile is taken in a non-fasting randomly timed sample a glucose measurement should be added with the rationale that CVD risk prediction will be improved in people with undiagnosed diabetes and that the added measurement carries a low opportunity cost.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The first premise is relatively uncontentious although it assumes the CVD risk equivalence between those with established diabetes and symptomatic CVD [7] also applies to newly detected diabetes.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The second premise deserves examination.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
Population-wide opportunistic screening strategies for diabetes require consideration of follow-on testing.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The ADDITION trial [14] indicates that a staged screening approach starting with a random capillary blood glucose and a glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) measure leads to 29% of the initial screened sample having to return for a fasting glucose measure 27% of whom require a full OGTT [15].,Brunner_2010.txt,0
These proportions may be higher if the initial stage is based solely on a random blood glucose as JBS2 recommends.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
The additional workload is likely to be complicated by the reluctance of many high-risk individuals to attend the second and third stages of diabetes screening.,Brunner_2010.txt,0
It is probable that our results accurately reflect the lack of added coronary risk stratification flowing from the JBS2 guideline on random glucose measurement in non-diabetic populations.,Brunner_2010.txt,0

"Of the few studies that assessed this question some suggest that HbA 1c may be superior [16,17] while others do not [13].",Brunner_2010.txt,0

The MetS consists of a clustering of metabolic risk factors and is associated with increased risk for CVD.,Liu_2007.txt,1
One of the features of MetS is impaired glucose regulation.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Several reports further indicate that dysglycemia regardless of its severity is accompanied by increased risk for CVD. [16][17][18],Liu_2007.txt,1
To date the relative contributions of MetS and dysglycemia on CVD risk have not been dissected.,Liu_2007.txt,0
For example Alexander et al 6 indicated that most of the risk for CHD associated with diabetes in the US population which is predominantly white can be explained by the coexistence of the MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Howard et al 19 reported that the elevated CHD risk in diabetes largely depends on concomitant risk factors in American Indians.,Liu_2007.txt,0
In contrast Stern et al 20 reported that in patients with existing CVD from the San Antonio Heart Study which is predominantly Hispanic most of CVD mortality occurs in persons with diabetes whereas MetS independent of diabetes has little impact on mortality.,Liu_2007.txt,0
To our knowledge whether MetS carries any additional CVD risk after excluding both prediabetes and diabetes and whether hyperglycemia in prediabetes or diabetes carries any additional CVD risk independent of other metabolic disorders are yet to be defined.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The current study was carried out in an effort to dissect the relative contributions of MetS and dysglycemia (including prediabetes and diabetes) to several forms of CVD in the Chinese population.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The overlap between MetS and dysglycemia in the Chinese population was marked.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Sixty-two percent of persons with MetS had either IFG or diabetes.,Liu_2007.txt,0

In addition dysglycemia is one of the components of the MetS diagnosis which added to the overlap.,Liu_2007.txt,1
But an important question is whether the increased CVD risk that is associated with MetS and with dysglycemia can be explained by dysglycemia per se or whether the greater risk can be attributed to a clustering of metabolic risk factors.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Our study showed that in the Chinese population the risk of developing CVD events in individuals with IFG or diabetes without MetS was mild and lower than the risk in those with MetS without IFG or diabetes.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Isolated hyperglycemic did not manifest a significantly higher risk of developing CVD unless other metabolic disorders were coexisted.,Liu_2007.txt,0
These findings strongly suggest that the risk of CVD seen in those with IFG or diabetes was largely attributable to the accompanying multiple metabolic abnormalities rather than hyperglycemia per se.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Our data are consistent with the findings from clinical trails which indicated multifactorial intervention rather than only intensive glycemic control is better in reducing CVD risk in patients with diabetes.,Liu_2007.txt,0

Detecting only diabetes or prediabetes is not sufficient to identify persons at higher risk for CVD because of metabolic disorders.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Actually about 40% of people with MetS did not manifest hyperglycemia.,Liu_2007.txt,0
However this group classified more people with obesity and other metabolic abnormalities and their CVD risk had already increased significantly.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Similarly most patients with dyslipidemia (65.6% for high TG and 69.1% for low HDL-C) did not present hyperglycemia: they were either isolated dyslipidemia or clustered with obesity or hypertension.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The high prevalence of isolated high TG or low HDL-C may partly be due to the high consumption of dietary carbohydrates in Chinese population.,Liu_2007.txt,0
23,Liu_2007.txt,0
Therefore when data were split by the status of MetS hyperglycemia was not associated with a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Among the metabolic risk factors hypertension has been reported to be the foremost contributor to risk for CVD in China.,Liu_2007.txt,1
"2,24",Liu_2007.txt,0
In the present study elevated BP was the only component of MetS which carried significant CVD risk in absence of other disorders.,Liu_2007.txt,1
A higher prevalence of hypertension was particularly evident in subjects with the MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,0
This higher BP thus appears to be a prominent component of the MetS in China.,Liu_2007.txt,1
15 Although there is much focus on the MetS as a prediabetic condition and on concern about its association with a rising prevalence of diabetes in China the importance of elevated BP as a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with the MetS and diabetes should not be overlooked.,Liu_2007.txt,1
25 Identification and early intervention of MetS is helpful to control hypertension and associated cardiovascular risk.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Another feature of the MetS in China was a much higher non-HDL-C level.,Liu_2007.txt,0
It can be explained by elevated concentrations of both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterolmarkers for atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins.,Liu_2007.txt,0
26,Liu_2007.txt,0
An elevation of the latter lipoproteins must be recognized as an integral part of MetS in China and a significant contributor to CHD and stroke.,Liu_2007.txt,1
"27,28 Since most persons with MetS had dysglycemia we can return to the question of whether most of the CVD risk associated with the MetS can be explained by an increase in plasma glucose levels.",Liu_2007.txt,0
The data are consistent with some contribution of dysglycemia to CVD risk but certainly not all.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Subjects with MetS and diabetes had higher rates of both CHD and ischemic stroke than did MetS subjects without diabetes.,Liu_2007.txt,0
This suggests that the hyperglycemia of diabetes carries independent risk.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The relatively low CHD risk associated with diabetes in the absence of MetS might be due to the limited cases in this group given the fact that few people had diabetes but without MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The contribution of different MetS traits to the incidence of CVD was also considered in the present study.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Our results are concordant with the findings from the Framingham Heart Study 29 that the associated CVD risk for various number and combinations of MetS components was heterogeneous.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Unlike their analysis which used the group without a specific combination as the comparator we used the group without any component as the reference to explore the bnetQ effect of a specific trait.,Liu_2007.txt,0
In the present study all those with z3 components had significantly higher CVD risk except for the rare combinations.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Our data corroborate the rationale of defining the cluster of z3 disorders as MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,1
Nevertheless the specific contribution of various MetS traits to CHD and stroke needs to be investigated in future studies with more events.,Liu_2007.txt,0
This study provides strong evidence that the multiple metabolic risk factors accompanying MetS is a major cause of both CHD and stroke in China.,Liu_2007.txt,1
Although there is a large overlap between MetS and dysglycemia in China the association between MetS and CVD cannot be explained entirely by dysglycemia.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Both hypertension and dyslipidemia which are common in persons with the MetS likely play an equal or greater role in the causation of CVD.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The data are consistent with the concept that the Chinese population is susceptible to development of multiple cardiovascular risk factors with the onset of obesity.,Liu_2007.txt,0
"3,30",Liu_2007.txt,0
If this is confirmed in further studies it provides a strong rationale for early intervention in the public health sphere to prevent the epidemic of obesity that is occurring in several other countries.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The main finding was a J-curved risk of long-term mortality in relation to FBG values.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
The excess risk associated with high FBG values was seen both in the group with already known diabetes and in the group with diabetic FBG values according to the WHO diagnostic criteria from 1985 while the excess risk was not significant those with diabetic FBG values according to the WHO diagnostic criteria from 1999 only.,Wandell_2005.txt,1
We also found an excess risk in subjects with low FBG values.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
"This J-shaped relationship between glucose levels and mortality is found in earlier studies e.g. in studies from the European DECODE Study [4,15] in a French study by Balkau et al. [3] and in an American study by Wei et al. [16].",Wandell_2005.txt,0
The lowest total mortality in the DECODE study published in 2003 was found in subjects with a FPG of 4.5-5.0 mmol/l [4] in the study by Balkau et al in the interval 5.25-5.75 mmol/l [3] and in the study by Wei et al (after adjustment) in the interval 4.4-6.1 mmol [16].,Wandell_2005.txt,1
In our study the lowest mortality was found was shown for subjects classified as IFG i.e.,Wandell_2005.txt,1
FBG values 5.6-6.0 mmol/l corresponding to FPG values 6.1-6.9 mmol/l thus higher than in the earlier mentioned studies.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
We have no satisfactory explanation to this finding.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
"The classification into IFG has been also been questioned earlier [15,17,18] and our findings seem to strengthen those concerns.",Wandell_2005.txt,1
Thus an IFG diagnosis does not in itself seem to denote an increased risk but indicates a need for further clinical investigation i.e. repeated fasting glucose values or oral glucose tolerance test to identify high-risk individuals.,Wandell_2005.txt,1
Diabetes and high fasting glucose values are associated with increased morbidity and mortality both CVD and non-CVD.,Wandell_2005.txt,1
However as regards subjects diagnosed with diabetes according to the WHO criteria from 1999 i.e. in the FBG interval 6.1-6.6 mmol/l (FPG 7.0-7.7 mmol/l) we were only able to demonstrate a moderate but non-significant excess risk in total mortality.,Wandell_2005.txt,1
"These criteria however were based on the risk of eye and kidney disease and not on risk of death [10,11].",Wandell_2005.txt,1
As regards the excess risk in low fasting glucose values the DECODE Study Group showed an excess risk at FPG Table III Cox regression models assessing total mortality risk during 26 years of follow-up among men and women respectively with different levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) measured in mmol/l.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Three models are presented Model I with adjustment for age and sex and Model II also including adjustment for category of care need and hypertension and Model III also addition of BMI-categories (BMI-values were missing for a few persons).,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Reference groups were: as regards hypertension normotensive subjects; as regards BMI-level those with BMI < 25 and as regards care need level those with no care need.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
As regards gender mortality of men was double that of women i.e. the pattern usually found.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Otherwise it is impossible to draw conclusions on gender differences of the mortality associated with the FBG-groups due to an insufficient number of subjects in the most important groups.,Wandell_2005.txt,0
Principal findings.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
The 1997 and 2003 IFG definitions are predictive of CHD in women but not in men.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
The odds of developing CHD among women with IFG in the 110 to 125 mg/dl (6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l) range approach the risk conferred by having diabetes.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
C-statistics were essentially unchanged between 1997 and 2003 IFG definitions suggesting no improvement in overall risk prediction when one uses the new IFG definition.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
For CVD only the 1997 IFG definition was associated with a statistically significant increased odds among women whereas no increased odds of CVD was observed in men for either IFG definition.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Ultimately however men have greater absolute rates of events as compared with women.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
With respect to diabetes the 1997 IFG definition is associated with a greater risk of developing diabetes compared with the 2003 IFG definition.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
A possible explanation for the difference between CVD and CHD is that the CHD end point contains primarily hard diagnoses that are known to be highly associated with diabetes and pre-diabetes such as myocardial infarction whereas CVD contains end points which are potentially more heterogeneous such as intermittent claudication and TIA.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Nonetheless women in our sample with FPG 110 to 125 mg/dl (6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l) are at significantly increased risk of both CHD and CVD.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
In the context of current literature.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Conflicting data exist regarding the effect of nondiabetic fasting hyperglycemia on cardiovascular risk.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
"Whereas several studies have found that the 1997 IFG definition is associated with significantly increased risk for CVD (2,9,11,21) at least 5 studies have shown no significantly increased risk for CVD with the 1997 IFG definition (5,8,10,22,23).",Levitzky_2008.txt,1
"Relatively fewer studies have examined the 2003 IFG cut point and its predictive capacity for CVD and none have demonstrated an increased risk (8 -10,24).",Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Kanaya et al. (9) examined data from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study which enrolled women with known coronary disease grouped them by fasting glucose status and followed them for CVD events stroke TIA and CHF hospitalization for an average of 6.8 years.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
They found that women with FPG 100 to 125 mg/dl (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/l) were at no increased risk for any end point as compared with women with normal levels of fasting glucose.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
In contrast we found that women categorized by the 2003 IFG definition do not have a statistically significant increased risk of CVD  (OR 1.4 95% CI 0.9 to 2.1) but do have significantly increased odds of CHD (OR 1.7 95% CI 1.0 to 3.0 p ϭ 0.048).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
A potential explanation for the differences in our findings may be the result of differences in our study sample which included only individuals free of CVD at baseline which is especially important when comparing our findings to those of Kanaya et al. (9) who used a sample of women with pre-existing CVD and followed their participants for new events.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
"In a recent publication from the Hoorn Study in which participants (n ϭ 1,428) were categorized according to 1997 and 2003 criteria based on OGTT measured in 1989 and 1996 with 10-year follow-up for all-cause and CVD mortality there was no significant increased risk for CVD unless participants developed diabetes (12).",Levitzky_2008.txt,1
These data are distinctly incongruent with our current findings possibly in part because of the lack of gender-specific analyses in the Hoorn study.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
The Hoorn investigators used oral glucose tolerance testing to diagnose impaired fasting glucose as compared with our use of FPG which may also be pertinent to understanding why our findings differed.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
However researchers using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study recently have confirmed that there is poor congruence between IFG (defined as 100 to 125 mg/dl; 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/l) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
They also demonstrate that neither IFG nor IGT are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality or incident CHD after a median follow-up of 6.3 years in fully-adjusted models (25).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Therefore we believe that our findings using FPG to diagnose IFG is an acceptable and clinically applicable method by which to conduct these analyses.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Finally a recent study from a community-based medical center examined CVD risk factor prevalence and prevalent CVD events among individuals with the 1997 as compared with the 2003 IFG definition (26) and found that the 2003 definition was not associated with an elevated level of CVD risk factors or CVD as compared to the 1997 definition.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
Gender differences.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
For any given glycemic category women had greater relative odds of CHD and CVD as compared with men although men had greater absolute event rates for cardiovascular disease.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
In fact the cardiovascular disease event rates and odds ratios for women in the 110 to 125 mg/dl group were similar to those for women with diabetes in our sample.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
"These findings build upon those from a recent meta-analysis that included more than 33,000 women and 172,000 men in examining nondiabetic hyperglycemia as a risk factor for CVD; results demonstrate that the risk of CVD events was markedly greater in cohorts that included women (27).",Levitzky_2008.txt,0
However gender-specific data for women in this meta-analysis were not presented.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Taken together with our findings CVD and diabetes risk in women may occur at lower glucose thresholds as compared with men which raises several potentially interesting questions.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Whether gender differences are due to intrinsic biologic differences or differences in risk factor management is uncertain.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
These differences also raise the question of whether gender-specific cut points for impaired fasting glucose should exist.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Implications.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
In the absence of a clear glucose threshold that is predictive of CVD the debate continues regarding what should define IFG to maximize sensitivity and specificity for predicting cardiovascular events.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
In examining the effect of IFG categorization with respect to cardiovascular disease we uncovered gender differences raising the question of whether a lower glycemic threshold should be used to diagnose IFG or diabetes in women.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
It is important to remember however that men have a greater absolute rate of events as compared with women.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Further IFG is not a CHD risk-equivalent.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
In addition whether the effect of identifying individuals with this diagnosis in clinical practice encourages lifestyle modification including weight loss and increased physical activity is uncertain.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Fasting blood sugar is often associated with other adverse CVD risk factors and may serve to identify patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Finally it is uncertain whether identifying an individual with IFG results in aggressive CVD risk factor modification; randomized clinical trials among individuals with IFG would be necessary to assess this.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Strengths and study limitations.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
The strength of our analysis lies in our population-based cohort and long-term follow-up.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
We assessed the glycemic status of our participants every 4 years and were able to remove those who developed incident diabetes from the IFG category which is particularly important when trying to understand the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with IFG independently of developing diabetes.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Our study has several limitations which must be acknowledged.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Oral glucose tolerance testing was not available at each index examination cycle thereby precluding comment on how the 1997 and 2003 IFG compare with IGT for prediction of CVD.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Further this unavailability may have resulted in cases of undiagnosed diabetes in our exposure group.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
However the primary point of our paper is to analyze the current ADA recommendations for IFG and current guidelines do not recommend the routine use of oral glucose tolerance testing (28).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
"""Next although we found no increased risk in men for CHD and CVD we examined short-term risk and application to long-term risk which allows for transition to diabetes over many years of follow-up is uncertain.",Levitzky_2008.txt,0
However the consideration of short-term risk is congruent with the ADAs recommendation that all individuals over 45 years of age be screened for diabetes every 3 years and even more frequently if additional risk factors are present (29).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Third the Framingham Heart Study at its inception in 1948 included only white participants.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Therefore the generalizability to other ethnic groups is uncertain.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
"However the Framingham risk score has been validated in other ethic groups and has been found to be applicable in other populations (30,31).",Levitzky_2008.txt,0
Although we used data from our study that spans several decades we do not believe that temporal trends would have an important effect on our results because we have previously shown that the relative risk between cardiovascular disease and diabetes has not changed over time (32).,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
"Finally we only evaluated cardiovascular complications of IFG and diabetes and were not able to assess retinopathy neuropathy and nephropathy which may yield different findings.""]",Levitzky_2008.txt,0
[Our data suggest that for prediction of CHD and CVD events neither IFG definition identifies a group of men at increased short-term risk.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
In women there is a significantly increased risk of CHD in the 2003 IFG group but this risk is driven primarily by the high event rate in participants with FPG 110 to 125 mg/dl (6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l).,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
In comparing women and men for any given prediabetic category women have a greater relative risk of CHD than men.,Levitzky_2008.txt,0
The 2003 IFG definition does not offer substantive advantages over the 1997 definition for prediction of CVD or diabetes.,Levitzky_2008.txt,1
In the 10 years follow-up study focusing on all causes of mortality among a Finnish community population aged 70 years or over men had higher mortality rate values than women.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Previously diagnosed diabetes predicted increased mortality and the relative risk was clearly higher among women.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
As in some earlier studies mainly conducted on middleaged populations the gender difference in mortality diminished with impairment of glucose tolerance among these elderly subjects [5].,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Previously diagnosed diabetes predicted higher mortality rates than IGT and NGT among the total population and among elderly women but not among elderly men.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
This is probably because of the larger proportion of female participants.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
All types of diabetes also predicted increased mortality in the total population.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"When diabetes and IGT were pooled in the analyses the present results also suggest as do some other earlier studies concerning middle-aged subjects that abnormal glucose tolerance may have a relatively greater impact on mortality in elderly women than in elderly men [15,16].",Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
This is also in accordance with results obtained in the 1980s by Pan et al. focusing on the early stages of diabetes and asymptomatic hyperglycemia.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"These assumptions are also in accordance with relatively recent data on newly diagnosed diabetes among middle-aged subjects in the DECODE Study [4,5].",Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The current results also confirm the findings of the previous shorter follow-up study of the present population for 3.5 years [17].,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
In combining earlier data derived mainly from younger populations and the present data it could be suggested that diabetes and IGT in elderly women increases mortality in all age groups.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Even after adjustment for age presence of cardiovascular disease and BMI the results of the present study are not in line with those of the metaanalysis of Kanaya et al. who concluded that the gender difference found in some studies is due to a failure to adjust results for classic risk factors of coronary heart disease [11].,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
However direct comparison of the present results with earlier studies is complicated because of methodological differences including variable durations of follow-up and differences in the age distributions of the study populations.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"""In the Seven Countries Study diabetes was associated with a 2.1-fold and IGT with a 1.17-fold mortality risk in a Finnish population aged 65-84 years.",Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
These results are very close to those of the present study when the age differences among study populations are taken into account [18].,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Present results also parallel those obtained by Swerdlow and Jones considering previously diagnosed diabetes and women.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"The results of the study by Swerdlow and Jones found a 1.45-fold relative risk of death among previously diagnosed elderly diabetic men and a 2.15 fold risk among diabetic women aged 60-84 years in a 25-year follow-up study [19].""",Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
High BMI was inversely and independently associated with increased mortality among women (OR 0.7 95% CI 0.6-0.9) but not among men (OR 1.2 95% CI 0.8-1.7) in this elderly population.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
Because of the smaller number of male participants (n = 141) the OR of 0.8 for the total population was similar to that for the women (n = 238).,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The small numbers of male participants limit the interpretation of the present results.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
However it seems that in women the contribution of obesity to increased mortality is diminished with advancing age.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
This relationship is opposite to that seen in younger people.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
It is worth noting that poor self-rated health was one of the best independent predictors of mortality in both genders in these elderly subjects even when adjustments were made for age gender BMI presence of cardiovascular disease and glucose status.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
There are several similar earlier findings concerning this topic including those of Pijls et al. in 1993 and Mossey and Shapiro in 1982.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"These studies found selfrated health to be an independent predictor of survival as well as one of the best predictors of the use of the health care services [20,21].",Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Based on similar findings in a large middle-aged Finnish population Miilunpalo et al. concluded that self-rated health is a valid health status indicator and can be used in population health monitoring [7].,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
In elderly subjects who often have multiple diseases and symptoms self-rated health status might offer a simple and easily administered tool for health status assessment in primary health care.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"""The main limitation of the findings of the present results is the relatively small size of the study population.",Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
The final classification of the diet-treated subjects was done according to the OGTT rather than reported diet-treated diabetes.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
Many of them according to medical records actually had nearnormal fasting values or IGT which were both generally labeled pre-diabetes at that time.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
However will successful life-style modification a person on a diet treatment may have had normal or IGT values for the subsequent OGTT.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"Thus the extent to which these factors have influenced the final results is not clear.""",Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
In conclusion previously diagnosed diabetes increased mortality rates in these elderly persons and the impact was more significant in women.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
In pooled data analyses of both previous and undiagnosed diabetes diabetes was also associated with increased mortality rates even when known risk factors for death related to cardiovascular problems were adjusted for.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
Self-rated health also represents one of the best predictors of mortality among elderly subjects.,Hiltunen_2005.txt,0
"In this large cohort of .370,000 individuals we confirm that HbA 1c is broadly linearly related to CVD risk in unadjusted analyses but that this association is substantially attenuated with adjustment for conventional CVD risk factors.",Welsh_2020.txt,0
Indeed in those with prediabetes while their unadjusted HR for CVD risk was 1.83 relative to those with normal HbA 1c  this fell to just 1.11 with adjustment for usual CVD risk factors.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
This means that while people with prediabetes on average have an ;80% greater CVD risk compared with those with normal HbA 1c levels such risk is largely driven not by elevated HbA 1c per se but rather by differences in the prevalence or levels of other established CVD risk factors: age blood pressure smoking lipid levels and BMI.,Welsh_2020.txt,1
Furthermore we show that addition of HbA 1c when the conventional risk factors are already accounted for does not meaningfully improve CVD risk prediction as shown by no gain in the NRI.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
In contrast the risk of CVD was meaningfully higher in those with diagnosed or undiagnosed baseline diabetes supporting the diagnostic cutoff for HbA 1c as it relates to CVD risk.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Our results add to existing literature by validating prior results published by the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) that demonstrated that while HbA 1c levels better predicted incident CVD events than fasting and postprandial glucose levels in those without prior diabetes or CVD the added predictive gain from inclusion of HbA 1c in risk prediction was modest.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The importance of Our results have practical implications for clinical practice.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
First these data are broadly supportive that HbA 1c should be used to diagnose prediabetes and new diabetes but also show that it is unlikely to be meaningfully additive for CVD risk prognostication in those without known diabetes.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Second all those found to have prediabetes on the basis of HbA 1c levels should have their CVD risk assessed by conventional methods i.e. with additional measurement of lipids and blood pressure as currently recommended (14) and it would not be appropriate to give only lifestyle advice to prevent or delay diabetes.,Welsh_2020.txt,1
Rather as those with prediabetes had higher baseline CVD risk with meaningfully higher mean SBP at just under 146 mmHg mean BMI just over 30 kg/m 2  and higher average total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratios they need comprehensive CVD risk management.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Finally given modest numbers with prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes (4% of cohort in total) the importance of using a non-laboratory test-based score first to identify those at highest risk for diabetes is reaffirmed.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
This means HbA 1c should only be measured in those with a high diabetes risk score as has been proposed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (15).,Welsh_2020.txt,0
We do however recognize that UK Biobank is not nationally representative but even so it is worth noting the relatively modest numbers with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
As with any study our work has strengths and limitations.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The current study is the largest single cohort reported to date to measure HbA 1c and assess CVD risk with standardized measurements across the cohort.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The limitations stem as noted above from UK Biobank cohort characteristicsda cohort somewhat healthier  than the average U.K. population.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The limitations also arise from lack of other glycemia measures although ERFC data have shown that HbA 1c is more strongly linked to CVD than is fasting glucose or 2-h glucose.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
Due to limited power we were also unable to examine whether associations of HbA 1c with outcomes were different by ethnicity.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
In conclusion in this very large wellphenotyped cohort with central laboratory assessment of HbA 1c  we show that HbA 1c minimally improves CVD risk prediction in patients without diabetes.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The same is also true for the subset with prediabetes.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
The near twofold higher unadjusted risk for CVD in prediabetes is driven mainly by abnormal levels of conventional CVD risk factors.,Welsh_2020.txt,0
As such and as recommended (14) this group would benefit from lifestyle advice to prevent diabetes and from having all conventional CVD risk factors assessed and where relevant treated.,Welsh_2020.txt,0

Our study has limitations.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
First prediabetes was defined only by fasting serum glucose and HbA1c but post-challenge glucose was not assessed.,Rhee_2016.txt,1

Second the specific type of cancer causing mortality was not identified; therefore more thorough analyses of the association between different types of cancer and diabetes could not be performed.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
Despite these limitations we demonstrate for the first time that in a large number of metropolitan Asian adults subjects with diabetes have increased risk for all-cause and cancer mortality at a relatively young age and that the HbA1c levels and mortality showed a J-shaped association with increased risk for mortality in subjects with both low and high HbA1c.,Rhee_2016.txt,0
In this community-based population without clinical cardiovascular disease we found that prediabetes and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with the 6-year incidence of subclinical myocardial damage as assessed by the elevation of cardiac troponin T detected with a novel highly sensitive assay.,Selvin_2014.txt,1
We further observed that these incident elevations in hs-cTnT were associated with future clinical outcomes particularly heart failure and death.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
In 2010 HbA1c was added to the tests recommended for use in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and the identification of persons at risk for diabetes mellitus.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
40 Our results suggest that persons with prediabetes when defined by HbA1c criteria are at risk for not only the subsequent development of diabetes mellitus 3 but also for the progression of subclinical cardiac damage and ensuing cardiovascular events.,Selvin_2014.txt,1
There has been controversy regarding the categories used to define prediabetes particularly the discordance between those persons identified using the recommended clinical cut points of 5.7% to 6.4% for HbA1c and 100 to 125 mg/dL for fasting glucose (impaired fasting glucose).,Selvin_2014.txt,1
Prediabetes particularly when defined by HbA1c criteria was associated with incident elevations of hs-cTnT and clinical outcomes demonstrating that whereas the prediabetes category of HbA1c identifies fewer people 41 persons with HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% are at a higher risk of progression of myocardial damage compared with persons with impaired fasting glucose.,Selvin_2014.txt,1

We also found that persons with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus who subsequently developed subclinical myocardial damage-as indicated by an incident elevation of hs-cTnT at the 6-year follow-up visit-were at highest risk of clinical events particularly heart failure and mortality.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Furthermore those persons without diabetes mellitus but who had incident elevated hs-cTnT were at similar or higher risk of heart failure and mortality compared with persons with diabetes mellitus but no incident elevation in hs-cTnT.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Indeed hs-cTnT significantly improved risk stratification for heart failure,Selvin_2014.txt,0
It is noteworthy that hs-cTnT was strongly associated with microvascular risk factors (eg hypertension and diabetes mellitus) and only weakly associated with traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (eg low-density lipoprotein cholesterol).,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Our previous work is also consistent with this finding that hs-cTnT reflects cardiac damage occurring via nonatherosclerotic mechanisms.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
"21,53",Selvin_2014.txt,0
The robust association between hyperglycemia and hs-cTnT may be mediated through microischemia because of the insufficiency of small intramyocardial arterioles (or possibly capillaries) reflecting primary small vessel disease or it is possible that this may reflect myocardial hypertrophy outstripping the capacity of the microvasculature to supply nutrients to the myocardium.,Selvin_2014.txt,0

The Study to Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus trial did demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk (an a priori secondary outcome) in a high-risk prediabetes population treated with acarbose compared with placebo although the total number of cardiovascular events was small (n=15 in the treatment arm and n=32 in the placebo arm).,Selvin_2014.txt,0
60 Nevertheless there are scant data on the effect of glucose-lowering interventions in persons with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus with no clinical cardiovascular disease at the outset.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
The current study had several limitations.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
We only had 2 measurements of hs-cTnT 6 years apart to characterize the progression of myocardial damage.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Adjustment for left ventricular hypertrophy was limited to assessment using ECG data only and despite rigorous adjustment for potential confounding factors including demographics blood pressure lipids adiposity kidney function and medication use we cannot eliminate the possibility of residual confounding in this observational setting.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Strengths of this study include the large community-based sample rigorous measurement of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the availability of HbA1c and fasting glucose measurements to characterize prediabetes.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
The long-term follow-up of the ARIC cohort and active surveillance for cardiovascular events and deaths allowed us to conduct secondary analyses of incident cardiovascular outcomes.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
In summary this study provides evidence for a deleterious effect of hyperglycemia on the myocardium even below the threshold for a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Furthermore those persons with evidence of incident subclinical myocardial damage were at high risk for future mortality and cardiovascular events particularly heart failure.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
With the growing dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes mellitus these results underscore the importance preventing progression to early hyperglycemic states and the development of diabetes mellitus.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
Our results suggest that primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease in diabetes mellitus for example via statin therapy may not be sufficient to fully address the cardiac risk associated with hyperglycemic states.,Selvin_2014.txt,0
The present study based on 9 northern European cohorts with a median length of follow-up of 12.9 years indicated that in individuals without previous diagnosis of diabetes the risk of ischemic stroke increased with increasing FPG and 2-hour PG levels but 2-hour PG contributed to the risk more strongly than FPG.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
The risk of ischemic stroke was clearly increased in individuals with previously diagnosed or screendetected diabetes.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0

To replace the MAP with systolic blood pressure in the data analysis did not alter the results either.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
Regardless of the relatively large sample size the low number of hemorrhagic stroke has impaired the precise estimates of the impact of hyperglycemia on hemorrhagic stroke.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
Also the follow-up length for many of the cohorts is still short with the low stroke events accumulated particularly when the strict criteria for acute stroke was applied.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
This made it impossible to analyze the data separately for men and women; therefore whether the effect is the same for men as for women is still not known and needs to be further explored in the future.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0
In summary this study showed that in individuals without previous diagnosis of diabetes the risk of ischemic stroke increased with increasing FPG and 2-hour PG levels 2-hour PG contributing to the risk more strongly than FPG.,Hyvarinen_2009.txt,0

"""This study had several advantages over previous studies.",Ma_2003.txt,0
Firstly the glucose tolerance of all subjects was determined through a combination of measurement of fasting glucose level and oral glucose tolerance testing.,Ma_2003.txt,0
"Several studies have shown that although both fasting glucose level and 2-hour postchallenge glucose level are associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality oral glucose tolerance testing is more sensitive and detects a larger number of at-risk persons (1,14,24).",Ma_2003.txt,0
"Furthermore the glucose tolerance test we used was a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test which allows our results to be readily compared with those of other studies unlike the case for some previous studies that used nonstandard oral glucose tolerance tests for diagnosis (2,8,15).",Ma_2003.txt,0
Secondly we believe that our study represents the first time that mortality associated with diabetes has been examined and compared in Chinese Indians and Malays living in Southeast Asia.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Thirdly our study population was a representative sample of an entire FIGURE 1.

The small number of deaths also precluded more detailed examination of the effects of diabetes on mortality in specific subgroups based on gender and/or age.,Ma_2003.txt,0

We also found (see table 2) that most of the excess mortality associated with known/newly diagnosed diabetes was related to cardiovascular disease (mortality ratio = 8.76; 95 percent CI: 4.94 15.52).,Ma_2003.txt,0
This is not surprising given that other studies of mortality in persons with diabetes have shown that cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death (18).,Ma_2003.txt,0
Even among persons with no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease antemortem autopsy studies have revealed extensive coronary atherosclerosis in the majority of persons with diabetes (27).,Ma_2003.txt,0
The excess mortality associated with diabetes could be due to the presence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors.,Ma_2003.txt,0
We previously reported that subjects with diabetes in this study population were older and more obese than those with normal glucose tolerance (28).,Ma_2003.txt,0
In addition blood pressure and serum triglyceride concentrations were higher among those with diabetes whereas serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were lower.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Subjects with IFG/ IGT had levels of cardiovascular disease risk factors that were intermediate between those of persons with normal glucose tolerance and persons with diabetes (29).,Ma_2003.txt,0

Singapore has undergone rapid economic development over the past 30 years.,Ma_2003.txt,0

Indians have the highest prevalence of diabetes and the greatest risk of cardiovascular disease followed by Malays and Chinese.,Ma_2003.txt,0

We have previously suggested that the greater prevalence of diabetes among Indians may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in this ethnic group (12).,Ma_2003.txt,0
However a subsequent prospective study showed that ethnicity remained a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease even after adjustment for diabetes and other cardiovascular disease risk factors (30).,Ma_2003.txt,0
Our current study provides an added dimension to those findings.,Ma_2003.txt,0
In addition to a higher prevalence of diabetes Malays and Indians with diabetes have mortality rates that are almost double those of Chinese (table 2).,Ma_2003.txt,0
An Indian with diabetes had a greater than threefold increased risk of mortality compared with a Chinese with diabetes.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Several hypotheses could explain these findings.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Firstly Indians and Malays may have more prolonged exposure to diabetes resulting in increased risk of mortality.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Cho et al. (31) showed recently that duration of diabetes significantly alters the risk of cardiovascular disease among diabetics with and without preexisting cardiovascular disease.,Ma_2003.txt,0
At baseline in this study the mean age at diagnosis among subjects with known diabetes was 47.3 years in Chinese 45.7 years in Malays and 45.8 years in Indians.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Among persons with diabetes newly diagnosed during the baseline examination the mean age was 48.7 years in Chinese 47.3 years in Malays and 44.2 years in Indians.,Ma_2003.txt,0
None of these differences reached statistical significance.,Ma_2003.txt,0
We believe that this lack of statistical significance may result from an inability to accurately determine the onset of diabetes due to a prolonged asymptomatic phase.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Furthermore we found that the ethnic group with the highest prevalence of diabetes had the lowest prevalence of IFG/IGT and vice versa (table 1).,Ma_2003.txt,0
Given that IFG and IGT are thought to be intermediate stages in the development of diabetes from the same pathologic processes it is possible that the high prevalence of IFG/IGT among Chinese is a consequence of slower progression to diabetes in this ethnic group.,Ma_2003.txt,1
In contrast Indians have the highest prevalence of diabetes and the lowest prevalence of IFG/IGT raising the possibility that in this ethnic group more of those at risk had converted to diabetes before they were studied.,Ma_2003.txt,0
To prove this hypothesis we would require a much longer period of follow-up with assessment of diabetes status at multiple time points.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Secondly we hypothesize that Indians and Malays have more prolonged exposure to other cardiovascular disease risk factors that are usually associated with diabetes.,Ma_2003.txt,0
"In Singapore Malays and Indians are more obese than Chinese and have greater insulin resistance and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations than Chinese (12,32).",Ma_2003.txt,0
These are all components of the metabolic syndrome and are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.,Ma_2003.txt,1
Although we previously reported that diabetes abolishes the ethnic differences in these metabolic parameters (28) the fact that these metabolic differences are present among Malays and Indians even in those with normal glucose tolerance suggests that they could well precede the development of diabetes in Malays and Indians.,Ma_2003.txt,0
As with the duration of diabetes more prolonged exposure to these risk factors could contribute to the greater mortality associated with diabetes in these ethnic groups.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Finally we also considered the possibility that these ethnic groups other risk factors for cardiovascular disease not examined in this study.,Ma_2003.txt,0
For example Indians in Singapore have been found to exhibit higher serum concentrations of lipoprotein(a) (33) which could add to the risk of cardiovascular disease in this ethnic group.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Perhaps of greater concern than the mortality risk among persons with known diabetes is the increased mortality associated with undiagnosed diabetes and the intermediate state of IFG/IGT.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Unlike the Paris Prospective Study and the Whitehall Study (19) undiagnosed diabetes in our population appears to be associated with lower mortality rates than does known diabetes.,Ma_2003.txt,1
Among those with diabetes subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes and known diabetes were similar in terms of blood pressure and lipid profiles.,Ma_2003.txt,0
However subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes were younger than persons with known diabetes (28).,Ma_2003.txt,0
It is possible that the lower age in the former group accounts for the lower mortality in this group in comparison with persons with known diabetes.,Ma_2003.txt,0
"While we focus on the dramatic increase in mortality associated with diabetes we must also bear in mind the small but significant increase in mortality associated with IFG/IGTa finding that confirms data from previous studies (1,14,24) including a recent meta-analysis (20).",Ma_2003.txt,0
Despite the small increase in mortality among persons with IFG/IGT as compared with diabetics overall 16.2 percent of the population had IFG/IGT after the results were weighted back to the 1990 population (data not shown).,Ma_2003.txt,0
IFG/IGT is twice as common as diabetes.,Ma_2003.txt,1
As a consequence the absolute number of deaths attributable to IFG/IGT approached that for diabetes.,Ma_2003.txt,0
This has resulted in identification of this subgroup for intensive control of other cardiovascular disease risk factors including the aggressive management of hyperlipidemia.,Ma_2003.txt,0
"Note also that the majority of persons classified as having IFG/IGT were classified as such on the basis of 2hour postchallenge glucose level and not fasting glucose level (data were reported previously (29,34)).",Ma_2003.txt,1
In the light of these findings it seems likely that 2-hour postchallenge glucose will continue to play a role in the identification of persons at high risk of developing complications especially among those with a fasting glucose level less than 7.0 mmol/ liter.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Modification of the current screening strategies which currently recommend limiting the use of an oral glucose tolerance test to persons with a fasting glucose level greater than 6.0 mmol/liter and less than 7.0 mmol/liter (34) may be required to optimize the detection of persons with IGT.,Ma_2003.txt,0
"This is important because lifestyle modification (35) and pharmacologic intervention (35,36) have been shown to successfully retard the progression of these intermediate states of hyperglycemia to diabetes and to reduce cardiovascular disease (37) in these subjects.",Ma_2003.txt,0
In conclusion we have shown that IFG/IGT and diabetes are associated with significant risk of mortality in Chinese Malays and Asian Indians.,Ma_2003.txt,1
Even in a developed country such as Singapore the proportion of persons with undiagnosed diabetes exceeds that of persons with known diabetes.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Diabetes has been identified as a coronary artery disease risk equivalent (38).,Ma_2003.txt,1
"It has also been shown that aggressive management of risk factors such as dyslipidemia is costeffective (39,40) and reduces not only cardiovascular disease (37) but also mortality (41) in these persons.",Ma_2003.txt,0
On the basis of these data we recommend a comprehensive screening program to detect these high-risk persons followed by aggressive management after diagnosis in order to reduce mortality and morbidity from this disease.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Such a program may be particularly important in other Southeast Asian countries where populations are similarly at risk of diabetes but remote locations make access to health care problematic.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Approximately 39% of subjects in the ARIC cohort without diabetes or a history of CVD were discordant on glucose impairment categories (i.e. isolated IFG or isolated IGT).,Pankow_2007.txt,1
In cross-sectional analysis subjects with combined glucose impairment (IFG/IGT) had the least favorable pattern of CVD risk factors.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Isolated IFG and isolated IGT had differing patterns of risk factors but neither category had a consistently worse CVD risk profile or excess of metabolic syndrome abnormalities.,Pankow_2007.txt,1
Measures of subclinical CVD and rates of all-cause mortality and incident CHD did not differ significantly between isolated IFG and isolated IGT.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
In 2003 the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recommended that the cut point for IFG be lowered from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l (6).,Pankow_2007.txt,1
"The primary rationale for the change was to make the sensitivity and specificity of IFG similar to that of IGT in predicting future risk of type 2 diabetes (6,38).",Pankow_2007.txt,0
"The change has been controversial (9,38 -42).",Pankow_2007.txt,0
"Population-based data from the U.S. and other countries indicate that the prevalence of IFG increased two-to fourfold upon application of the new criteria (9,12,39,43,44) with the largest increases in IFG in younger age-groups (39).",Pankow_2007.txt,1
A recent report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 -2002 estimated that 26 million U.S. adults have IFG using the lower cut point (45).,Pankow_2007.txt,1
In the present study the overall prevalence of isolated IFG was higher than the prevalence of isolated IGT among subjects without a history of CVD suggesting that the new definition of IFG does not necessarily produce equivalent numbers of subjects in the IFG and IGT categories.,Pankow_2007.txt,1
Furthermore the lower cut point for IFG produced only slightly better agreement between IFG and IGT categories.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
The prevalence of isolated IFG and isolated IGT differed by sex and to a lesser extent by race.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
More specifically isolated IFG was more common than isolated IGT among black men and women and white men but not among white women.,Pankow_2007.txt,1
"Studies with the higher (11,46) and lower (11,13) cut point for IFG have reported at least in relative terms that women are more likely to have isolated IGT and men are more likely to have isolated IFG.",Pankow_2007.txt,1
Whether there are important differences according to race or ethnicity is less clear.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Based on World Health Organization definitions IGT was more common than IFG in both non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black subjects in the U.S. but discrepancies between IGT prevalence and IFG prevalence were most evident in non-Hispanic white women (47).,Pankow_2007.txt,1
"Cross-sectional studies (11,13,48 -51) most using the higher IFG cut point have found inconsistent differences in CVD risk factors between isolated IFG and isolated IGT categories.",Pankow_2007.txt,1
Although we found statistically significant differences between isolated IFG and isolated IGT for most CVD risk factors absolute differences were generally small and not consistently higher in one category or the other.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
An Expert Consensus,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Workshop of the International Diabetes Federation recently concluded that IFG is characterized by raised hepatic glucose output and deficits in early insulin secretion while IGT is characterized by peripheral insulin resistance (2).,Pankow_2007.txt,1
Data from the present study suggest that subjects with IFG are more insulin resistant if fasting insulin is interpreted as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
"However studies using direct measures of insulin resistance (i.e. euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp or frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test) have found that subjects with isolated IGT have similar (51) if not greater (48,50) deficiencies in insulin action compared with subjects with isolated IFG.",Pankow_2007.txt,0
Neither isolated IFG nor isolated IGT was more strongly associated with measures of subclinical CVD in the ARIC cohort.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Our data appear to contrast with that of the RIAD (Risk Factors in IGT for Atherosclerosis and Diabetes),Pankow_2007.txt,0
Study which found that carotid IMT was more strongly associated with IGT than IFG in middle-aged subjects (52).,Pankow_2007.txt,0
We are unsure why patterns of association between IFG IGT and carotid IMT differ in the two studies.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Associations between fasting glucose and carotid IMT among nondiabetic subjects were weak in ARIC at visit 1 (53); our data corroborate those earlier findings.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Unlike the present study a metaregression analysis of 20 prospective studies found a significant graded relationship between CVD events and glucose level both fasting and postchallenge (3).,Pankow_2007.txt,0
"Some studies (44,54,55) have reported a J-shaped relation between fasting or 2-h postchallenge glucose and CVD or total mortality with subjects having the lowest glucose levels having slightly increased risk relative to those in low-normal categories.",Pankow_2007.txt,0
However the lack of association between fasting glucose and incident CHD in our study is consistent with earlier reports from the ARIC cohort.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
In one analysis fasting glucose levels Ͻ6.4 mmol/l at the baseline exam (visit 1) were not associated with incident CHD over 4 -7 years of follow-up (56).,Pankow_2007.txt,1
In another analysis fasting glucose measured at visit 2 was not associated with incident CHD over 8 -10 years of follow-up among nondiabetic subjects (57).,Pankow_2007.txt,0
By contrast A1C levels Ͼ4.6% at visit 2 demonstrated a positive graded association with incident CHD among individuals without diabetes (57).,Pankow_2007.txt,1
"It is unclear why the present study failed to find an association between postchallenge glycemia and all-cause mortality or incident CHD that has been reported elsewhere (13,(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)58,59).",Pankow_2007.txt,0
The median follow-up of 6.3 years may have been too short for an association to emerge as many earlier studies had longer follow-up for nonfatal and fatal outcomes.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
In the Whitehall Study of British men decreased survival among glucose-intolerant subjects only became apparent between 5 and 10 years of follow-up (58).,Pankow_2007.txt,0
However in an analysis of 14 European cohorts by the DECODE group hazard ratios for CVD death associated with IGT and/or IFG were lower after 10 years of follow-up compared with 5 years of follow-up (60).,Pankow_2007.txt,0
It is possible that in studies with longer follow-up a high proportion of individuals with IGT at baseline develop diabetes as an intermediate condition before onset of CHD or death.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Associations between baseline IGT and these long-term outcomes may therefore be explained by greater risk of diabetes among those with IGT.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
However development of diabetes during follow-up was not found to be an intermediate factor linking baseline IGT and incident CHD in a Finnish cohort study (61).,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Approximately 14% of subjects without prevalent CVD and diabetes were excluded from our analysis for other reasons mainly because they refused the OGTT.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Our results may have underestimated the association between glucose impairment and all-cause mortality or incident CHD if subjects with glucose impairment who developed these outcomes were more likely to be excluded.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Subjects who were excluded were more likely to be African American and smoke and had lower BMI higher HDL cholesterol and higher systolic blood pressure than those not excluded.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
After adjusting for age sex race and center subjects who were excluded had higher rates of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.53 [95% CI 1.21-1.94]) but similar rates of incident CHD (1.16 [0.88 -1.52]) compared with subjects not excluded.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
However mean fasting glucose was similar in excluded subjects compared with those not excluded and the magnitude of association between fasting glucose and all-cause mortality or incident CHD was the two groups suggesting that the results are representative for all subjects in the cohort without CVD and diabetes.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Possible differences in the etiology and long-term risk associated with IFG and IGT to delineate in light of the population impact of CVD morbidity and mortality and inconsistent use of the OGTT in clinical settings.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
However neither IFG nor IGT were important predictors of incident CHD or all-cause mortality in the ARIC cohort.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
The relatively poor agreement between fasting and postchallenge glucose levels and differing patterns of association with CVD risk factors suggest that IFG and IGT do not represent metabolically equivalent categories.,Pankow_2007.txt,1
In this Chinese nationwide prospective cohort study of 111 765 adults participants with prediabetes or diabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs exhibited lower or no significant excess risk of CVD events compared with those with normal glucose regulation.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Compared with 1 ICVHM or none 5 or more ideal metrics were associated with 58% and 61% lower CVD risks among participants with prediabetes and diabetes respectively.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Each additional ICVHM was associated with 18% and 15% lower risks of CVD events among participants with prediabetes and diabetes respectively.,Wang_2019.txt,0
To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to comprehensively investigate the association of ICVHMs with CVD events among individuals with diabetes or prediabetes.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Randomized clinical trials evaluating cardiovascular effects of multifactorial interventions in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes are sparse and yield mixed results.,Wang_2019.txt,0
[24][25][26][27][28]   (24 881 with normal glucose regulation 61 024 with prediabetes and 25 860 with diabetes) were included in the analysis.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Hazard ratios (95% CI) were adjusted for age sex education attainment (less than high school or high school or greater) family history of diabetes (yes or no) and family history of CVD (yes or no).,Wang_2019.txt,0
Interaction between the combination of glucose tolerance status with number of ICVHMs and age on CVD: P for interaction = .02 (A); P for interaction <.001 (B).,Wang_2019.txt,0
Interaction between the combination of glucose tolerance status with number of ICVHMs and sex on CVD: P for interaction = .59 (C); P for interaction = .35 (D). with type 2 diabetes showed that intensive lifestyle intervention focused on weight loss did not reduce CVD events over a median of 9.6 years of follow-up.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Prospective observational studies with regard to cardiovascular effects among patients with diabetes are limited and have mainly assessed lifestyle behaviors.,Wang_2019.txt,0
[29][30][31],Wang_2019.txt,0
In this study taking advantage of the AHA ICVHMs we analyzed a comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor profile to ascertain its association with CVD risk.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Importantly we found that patients with prediabetes or diabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs appeared to have no significant excess or even lower risk of CVD events compared with the overall population with normal glucose regulation.,Wang_2019.txt,0
In view of the rising epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes globally and in China our findings emphasize the importance of an early intervention targeting both lifestyle behaviors and metabolic profiles among individuals with prediabetes and diabetes for the prevention of CVD.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Interestingly we detected that among younger individuals patients with prediabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs showed lower CVD risk than individuals with normal glucose regulation while such an association was not seen among older individuals.,Wang_2019.txt,0
We speculate that the high prevalence of comorbidities and medications for chronic diseases among the elderly population may compromise the benefit of the ICVHMs.,Wang_2019.txt,0
14,Wang_2019.txt,0
However our results did indicate that even among the elderly individuals with prediabetes or diabetes each additional ICVHM was associated with substantially lower risk of CVD (11% to 13%) highlighting the benefit of achieving and maintaining an ideal cardiovascular health across the life course.,Wang_2019.txt,0
32,Wang_2019.txt,0
With regard to each component of cardiovascular health metrics an ideal blood pressure was predominantly associated with lower CVD risks among individuals with prediabetes or diabetes.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Surprisingly an ideal HbA 1c level was not independently associated with the CVD risk among individuals with prediabetes.,Wang_2019.txt,0
In 2018 the Whitehall II Study 10 of 5427 participants aged 50 to 79 years reported that the risk of CVD associated with prediabetes defined by HbA 1c was absolutely  ],Wang_2019.txt,1
[The strengths of this study included the large nationwide sample size the prospective study design the well-validated definitions of the CVD outcomes and the comprehensive analyses including individuals with normal glucose regulation prediabetes or diabetes.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Our study also has notable limitations.,Wang_2019.txt,0
First the relatively short follow-up duration might limit the statistical power for CVD events.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Second the cardiovascular health metrics were evaluated only at baseline so changes in the metrics over time could not be accounted for in this study.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Participants who were excluded owing to missing data on cardiovascular health metrics included a slightly higher pro-portion of men so a selection bias may exist.,Wang_2019.txt,0
The results then should be interpreted cautiously.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Third we evaluated an ideal diet mainly on the basis of fruit and vegetable intake and the absence of comprehensive dietary data may underestimate the actual association of a healthy diet with CVD events.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Fourth we could not fully rule out all the residual and unmeasured confounders such as genetic predisposition medications and psychological status and possible reverse causation.,Wang_2019.txt,0
Our results indicate that prediabetes is capable of differentially contributing to the mortality from each vascular disease subtypes in the general population; compared with NGT a higher degree of IFG (stage 2 110-125 mg/dL of fasting plasma glucose) was associated with a cantly mortality risk from IS but not from IHD or HS.,Kim_2017.txt,1
Given that the IFG stage 2 was also associated with a higher vascular disease mortality our results further suggest that this increased vascular disease mortality was mainly attributable to the increased IS mortality.,Kim_2017.txt,1
In contrast a lower degree of IFG (stage 1 100-109 mg/dL of fasting plasma glucose) did not increase mortality because of vascular disease or any of its subtypes.,Kim_2017.txt,1
The prevalence of prediabetes is increasing worldwide with the current prevalence estimated at >30% in various regions and ethnic groups.,Kim_2017.txt,0
3 Likewise in Korea an alarming increase in prediabetes prevalence has been reported from 21.5% in 2006 to 25.0% in 2013.,Kim_2017.txt,0

[To summarize we observed that subjects with prediabetes especially those with a higher fasting plasma glucose (110-125 mg/dL) had a significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke mortality.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Therefore an evaluation of the stroke-associated modifiable risks and formulation of stroke prevention strategies should be undertaken.,Kim_2017.txt,0
Further investigations are needed to evaluate the different mechanisms underlying the development of IHD and stroke and to design beneficial strategies to decrease each vascular disease risks.,Kim_2017.txt,0
In this large cohort reflecting the general elderly German population prediabetes and diabetes were very common and were associated with an increased burden of conventional cardiovascular risk factors.,Schottker_2013.txt,1
The observed higher risk for a major CVE of individuals with IFG and HbA 1c -defined prediabetes could mainly be explained by other cardiovascular risk factors whereas strong associations persisted after adjustment for individuals with manifest diabetes mellitus.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Adding FPG or HbA 1c to the variables of the SCORE did not improve its predictive abilities for CVE in individuals without diabetes mellitus (except for a statistically non-significant slight improvement for men when adding HbA 1c ).],Schottker_2013.txt,0
"[In agreement with other studies [10,11,25] we showed in a previous analysis of the ESTHER data that the new HbA 1c -based prediabetes definition and IFG have a low proportion of overlap [12].",Schottker_2013.txt,1
Nevertheless individuals with IFG and those with HbA 1cdefined prediabetes showed a similarly increased burden of cardiovascular risk factors.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
In concordance with findings from a recently published study the most important difference was that more men were classified with prediabetes by FPG than by HbA 1c [26].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Although most of the cardiovascular risk factors were statistically significantly increased in the prediabetes groups the clinical importance of the differences was small when compared with the large differences observed between individuals with and without manifest diabetes mellitus.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Risk for incident cardiovascular events,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The observed HRs for CVEs in the following 8 years for individuals with IFG HbA 1c -defined prediabetes and manifest diabetes were in line with estimates from previous studies.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
"The pooled risk Adjusted for age sex systolic blood pressure current smoking and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio IR incidence rate per 1,000 person-years; PY person-years at risk; Ref. reference ratio from three studies on the association of IFG and cardiovascular outcomes was slightly higher in women (1.16 95% CI 0.99 1.36) and comparable in men (1.23 95% CI 1.06 1.42) [6].",Schottker_2013.txt,0
To our knowledge the association of the new HbA 1c -defined prediabetes definition and CVE has only been investigated in a study from northern Finland [8].,Schottker_2013.txt,1
The reported relative risks for women of 0.96 (95% CI 0.62 1.49) and for men of 1.17 (95% CI 0.78 1.74) are consistent with the estimates from our cohort.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Moreover our study confirmed higher HRs for men with prediabetes than for women with prediabetes with estimates of HRs for the latter being very close to the null effect value of one.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The sex difference was marginal for HbA 1c -defined prediabetes and more pronounced for IFG which might be caused by the higher proportion of men in the IFG group.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Nevertheless the association of IFG and CVE in men was also weak and supports the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk induced by an increased serum glucose load starts to increase to a clinically relevant extent after the manifestation of diabetes mellitus.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
In our cohort women and men with diabetes showed a 1.7-and 1.9-fold increased risk for CVE respectively.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
These estimates are lower than those reported by roughly comparable sex-specific analyses in three other cohorts which had risk-ratio point estimates ranging from 3.5 to 4.9 for women and from 2.1 to 3.0 for men [27][28][29] but agree with the approximately twofold increased risk for a wide range of vascular diseases estimated in 102 prospective studies of the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) [20].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The quite low CVE risk of individuals with diabetes in our cohort might be explained by the relatively short mean duration of diabetes reflecting the high proportion of individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes identified by the health check-up (21% of all diabetes diagnoses) [1].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
However the sex-combined cardiovascular risk estimates for increasing FPG and HbA 1c levels in the individuals with diabetes in our study matched perfectly with estimates from meta-analyses of other prospective studies: HR for a 1 mmol/l FPG increase 1.10 (95% CI 1.05 1.16) vs 1.12 (95% CI 1.08 1.15) [20] and for a 1% HbA 1c increase 1.23 (95% CI 1.12 1.36) vs 1.18 (95% CI 1.10 1.26) [30] respectively.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Utility of FPG and HbA 1c in cardiovascular risk prediction in individuals without diabetes mellitus Although AUCs for the SCORE variables were lower in individuals without diabetes in our cohort (women: 0.71 men: 0.63) compared with those estimated in a similar investigation in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort for the Framingham Score (women: 0.80 men: 0.72) the difference between the sexes was consistent [9].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The overall lower AUCs may be explained by the higher mean baseline age of the ESTHER cohort (62.5 years) compared with the EPIC-Norfolk cohort (58 years) when keeping in mind the strong attenuation of the AUC of cardiovascular risk scores in individuals older than 65 years [31].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Adding FPG or HbA 1c to the SCORE variables resulted in small non-significant NRIs and IDIs for both sexes.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
These patterns are consistent with the non-significant findings for adding FPG to the Framingham Score variables in the Whitehall II study (NRI 1.8%) [19] and the ERFC (NRI −0.18% IDI 0.04%) [20].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Our data are also in agreement with findings from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort [9] that HbA 1c could have a value in CVE prediction in non-diabetic men (NRI 2.2% vs 3.4% respectively) but not women (NRI −0.2% vs −2.2% respectively).,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Furthermore the results for men are in line with findings from the ADDITION study [32] that combined a SCORE result of ≥5 with an HbA 1c value ≥6.0% and identified 96.7% of those who would benefit from an intervention compared with 91.7% if the screening was performed with only those with a SCORE result ≥5.,Schottker_2013.txt,1
This is one possibility of how to implement the additional predictive value of HbA 1c for CVE for men into routine screening programmes with the SCORE.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
As screenings for cardiovascular diseases and undiagnosed diabetes are usually combined HbA 1c or FPG could easily be added to a cardiovascular risk assessment.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
"Furthermore a diagnosis of prediabetes might be useful as a motivation to change diet and physical activity habits that could result in a decrease in both the diabetes and cardiovascular risk [33,34].",Schottker_2013.txt,1
However it should be noted that the NRIs for adding HbA 1c in non-diabetic men were small and not statistically significant in our cohort (p00.16) and in the EPIC-Norfolk study (p00.06).,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Further research is required to explore whether this relatively small NRI of 2.2-3.4% can be confirmed and determine its clinical relevance.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Limitations and strengths,Schottker_2013.txt,0
When interpreting the results the following limitations and strengths should be considered.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The lack of an OGTT meant we could not compare all three prediabetes definitions (IGT IFG and HbA 1c -defined prediabetes).,Schottker_2013.txt,0
However the performance of the OGTT in prediabetes screening would have been only of theoretical interest because an OGTT is inconvenient for screening [13].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The strengths are physician-confirmed event status and the high completeness of the mortality follow-up.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
A further strength of the ESTHER study is its representativeness of a population that attends screenings.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
"Nevertheless the distribution of sociodemographic baseline characteristics and common prevalent chronic diseases in our study were similar to the distribution in the respective age categories in the German National Health Survey which is a representative sample of the German population [21,22] a fact supporting the external validity of our study.",Schottker_2013.txt,0
FPG screening has been performed under conditions of routine medical practice.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
A limitation might be that physicians and possibly also participants were aware of the FPG results but not the HbA 1c results.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
Individuals with IFG might have been counselled and changed their lifestyle and would therefore be at lower cardiovascular risk than individuals with HbA 1c -defined prediabetes.,Schottker_2013.txt,0
However this theoretical limitation does not seem to have had much influence on the results because the estimated HR for CVE of participants with IFG (HR 1.11 95% CI 0.88 1.38 for both sexes combined) is concordant with the pooled HR of a metaanalysis of studies that had different recruitment procedures (HR 1.18 95% CI 1.09 1.28) [6].,Schottker_2013.txt,0
The from this large national populationbased cohort study indicate that after adjustment for the traditional CVD risk factors the 5-year mortality from all causes was significantly greater for KDM IFG and IGT than for NGT.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Persons with KDM had a mortality risk that was more than 2 times greater than those with NGT and those with IGT and IFG had a 50% to 60% greater mortality risk.,Barr_2007.txt,1
The risk of CVD mortality was also significantly greater for those with KDM and IFG but not IGT compared with NGT.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Finally the importance of abnormal glucose metabolism to the risk of CVD mortality is supported by the present finding that 65% of all CVD deaths occurred in people with KDM NDM IFG or IGT at baseline.,Barr_2007.txt,1
Experimental studies have long indicated that abnormal glucose metabolism increases the likelihood of macrovascular disease because it disrupts normal endothelial function accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation and contributes to plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis.,Barr_2007.txt,1
19,Barr_2007.txt,0
In addition the risk attributed to other CVD risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia may be compounded by the presence of abnormal glucose metabolism.,Barr_2007.txt,0
There have been many studies that have demonstrated that diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for both all-cause and CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7],Barr_2007.txt,0
The present finding of a strong association between KDM and mortality is consistent with these data.,Barr_2007.txt,0
However we did not find a significant association between NDM and all-cause or CVD mortality although after adjustment for known risk factors NDM was associated with a 30% increased risk (HR 1.3 95% CI 0.9 to 2.0) for all-cause mortality and an 80% increased risk (HR 1.8 95% CI 0.9 to 3.6) for CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,1
This may have been due to the relatively small number of deaths among those in the NDM group (nϭ27) over the 5-year follow-up period.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Even though risk is greater in those who have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus for a longer period of time other longerterm studies have reported that people identified with NDM are also at significantly greater risk for both all-cause and CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"8,9,20 Fewer studies have investigated the impact of IGT and IFG on all-cause and CVD mortality 2,8,20 -23 with most of the evidence derived from large meta-analyses that combined results from a number of diverse populations (occupationand population-based samples).",Barr_2007.txt,0
"9,10,13",Barr_2007.txt,0
The DECODE (Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Europe) and DECODA (Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Asia) metaanalyses reported that IGT not IFG was a strong predictor of all-cause and CVD mortality independent of fasting blood glucose.,Barr_2007.txt,1
"9,10",Barr_2007.txt,0
In contrast Coutinho et al 13 demonstrated that the threshold value for IFG (fasting glucose Ն6.1 mmol/L) was significantly associated with fatal and nonfatal CVD events.,Barr_2007.txt,1
The present study now adds to these observations.,Barr_2007.txt,0
We showed that not only is IGT associated with all-cause mortality but IFG appears also to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The differences between the present study data and the DECODE and DECODA analyses could reflect different study methods.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"The DECODE and DECODA meta-analyses compared the IFG group with people without IFG whereas the comparison group in the present study consisted of people who had both ""normal"" FPG (Ͻ6.1 mmol/L) and 2-hour PG (Ͻ7.8 mmol/L) values which allowed better discrimination of mortality risk between those with IFG and NGT.",Barr_2007.txt,0
Furthermore these meta-analyses relied on different blood glucose samples (eg whole blood and plasma) and analyzed the glucose measurements with different assays.,Barr_2007.txt,0
This meant that glucose values obtained from whole blood had to be manipulated statistically before the results were pooled with the plasma glucose results.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Consequently this could have influenced the precision of the results reported in the studies.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The AusDiab study used a single assay to analyze all plasma glucose samples and analyses were performed in a central laboratory according to standardized criteria.,Barr_2007.txt,0
In contrast with the findings from DECODE 9 DECODA 10 and Coutinho et al 13 that showed a significant positive   relationship between IGT and CVD mortality we found that IGT was only a significant predictor for all-cause mortality not for CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
This may be largely explained by our observation that IGT was significantly associated with non-CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Although our investigate the specific non-CVD causes of death was limited by inadequate sample size it is possible to infer that in the present study cohort IGT may increase the risk of cancer mortality because the underlying cause for the majority (59.3%) of non-CVD deaths was attributable to malignant neoplasm.,Barr_2007.txt,0
This concurs with the findings reported by other studies.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"21,24,25",Barr_2007.txt,0
Other explanations include the possibility that the effects of IGT on CVD mortality may be mediated by the clustering of hypertension dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia rather than by hyperglycemia per se although the age-and sex-adjusted CVD mortality rates also were not higher in participants with IGT.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Misclassification of IGT status due to a single oral glucose tolerance test may also have led to attenuation of an association of IGT and CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Previous data suggest that a significant proportion of the population with IFG or IGT develops diabetes mellitus.,Barr_2007.txt,0
11 Hence when one interprets findings from studies that have used a longer follow-up period it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the prediabetes status (ie IFG or IGT) or the development of diabetes mellitus among those with these disturbances of glucose metabolism that is directly associated with the risk of mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The increased risk of mortality for IGT and IFG after only a relatively short period of follow-up in the present study suggests that conversion to diabetes mellitus was not a major pathway to death and that IFG and IGT are genuine risk factors for mortality and not just precursors of diabetes mellitus.,Barr_2007.txt,1
These findings are consistent with the presence of a continuous relationship between increasing blood glucose and increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"13,26,27 Several studies have shown that abnormal glucose metabolism is present in approximately two thirds of patients with acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease.",Barr_2007.txt,0
28 -30 However it is difficult to generalize some of these results to the wider community because they are derived from clinicand hospital-based populations and are subject to survivor bias.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Furthermore the cross-sectional nature of the studies limits conclusions about causality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The present study extends this previous work because our longitudinal populationbased data showed that 65% of all CVD deaths occurred in those with diabetes mellitus IFG or IGT at baseline.,Barr_2007.txt,0
This figure of 65% is far higher than the prevalence observed in the general population aged Ն25 years (reported to be 24%) and is also higher than the prevalence of abnormal glucose metabolism (reported to be 53%) seen in Australian adults aged Ն75 years.,Barr_2007.txt,1
31,Barr_2007.txt,0
"This suggests that the public health benefits of targeting CVD prevention toward those with ""prediabetes"" and diabetes mellitus would be significant.",Barr_2007.txt,0
"""The findings of the present study need to be considered within the context of its limitations.",Barr_2007.txt,0
The differences between responders and nonresponders indicate that the cohort may not have been fully representative of Australian adults; however these differences are unlikely to affect the strength of the relationships between glucose tolerance categories and mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The present study has relied on the results of a single oral glucose tolerance test to determine the participants glucose metabolism status and therefore misclassification may have occurred.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The use of self-reported CVD as a covariate may also represent some measurement error; however studies conducted in community-based populations have found self-reported myocardial infarction [32][33][34] stroke [32][33][34][35] and ischemic heart disease 33 to be moderately to highly accurate in determining disease status.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Furthermore to account for CVD event measurement error other covariates associated with CVD such as age sex hypertension lipids lipid-lowering medication use and waist circumference were also included in the multivariate models.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Misclassification of death status and cause of death was also possible because these outcomes were determined through matching the cohort to the NDI which is derived from death certificate data.,Barr_2007.txt,0
However a previous study has shown that the ascertainment of vital status and CVD deaths through the NDI is robust with sensitivity and specificity for the identification of deaths being 93.7% and 100% respectively and sensitivity and specificity for CVD deaths being 92.5% and 89.6% respectively.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"18 Inadequate statistical power as a result of the shorter follow-up period has also limited our ability to conduct further stratified analyses at this time although it is planned that this will be explored after a longer follow-up period.""",Barr_2007.txt,0
In summary this large contemporary population-based cohort study provides further data on the relationship between abnormal glucose metabolism and CVD and all-cause mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
These findings suggest that strategies to prevent premature mortality particularly CVD death need to be *For all-cause mortality adjusted for age sex previously reported CVD smoking (current or ex-smoker) hypertension (blood pressure Ն140/ 90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication) waist circumference (cm) lipid-lowering medication use and total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio.,Barr_2007.txt,0

In this large cohort study of Korean men we have shown that the association between FBG level and CVD differed according to specific disease categories.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Once other CVD risk factors were taken into account there was a linear association between FBG level Ͼ5.6 mmol/L and IS but for IHS and MI only those in the very highest category of FBG or those with existing diabetes were at increased risk.,Sung_2009.txt,0
The level of FBG at which relative risk of IS started to increase was lower than the current cutoff level used to diagnose diabetes.,Sung_2009.txt,0
The findings of different associations between glycemia and different stroke subtypes in our study suggest that evaluation of the risk of hyperglycemia associated with the stroke without any consideration of stroke subtypes may mask the size of risk associated with IS somewhat.,Sung_2009.txt,0
"Given the wide variation in the stroke subtype incidence between populations 17,18 the different associations of FBG across major CVD subtypes need to be considered together with the population prevalence of each subtype to set the level of FBG at which CVD hazard starts to increase in a population.",Sung_2009.txt,0
We hypothesized that IHS may have a different association with hyperglycemia from IS as has been found with other common risk factors such as cholesterol obesity and smok-ing.,Sung_2009.txt,0
"24 -27 Previous studies have either not contributed detailed data on stroke subtypes when studying the effect of diabetes 16,28,29 and prediabetes 5,30 or have shown either a decrease 15 or an increase 17 in risk of IHS in diabetic subjects warranting further clarification of the association between hyperglycemia and IHS.",Sung_2009.txt,0
"Previous studies have been limited by the small number of IHS events 3,29 or because a retrospective study design was employed.",Sung_2009.txt,0
15 Even findings from major prospective cohort studies have had limited statistical power: the Framingham Study with only 18 IHS events reported a positive association whereas the Honolulu Heart Study with 112 IHS events showed no association but both studies had produced estimates with wide CIs that actually appear to be statistically consistent with each other.,Sung_2009.txt,0
17 With larger numbers of IHS cases wider glycemic variation and available information about other cardiovascular risk factors we believe that our study may provide better insight into the association between FBG and IHS.,Sung_2009.txt,0
In our study a positive association was observed with IHS when BP cholesterol and BMI were not adjusted but it was markedly attenuated in fully adjusted analysis.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Our examination of this association in those with no prior diagnosis of diabetes suggests that diagnosed diabetes is associated with increased risk of IHS but beyond this group FBG is not a major independent risk factor for IHS.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Our hypothesis that the association of FBG with IHS might differ from that with IS and MI was in part based on results  Assessed by putting the continuous scale of the glucose groups in the corresponding model.,Sung_2009.txt,0
¶Assessed by putting the continuous scale of the glucose groups in the corresponding model after excluding those whose FBG level was very low (Ͻ4.6 mmol/L) or above the cutoff level of diabetes mellitus (Ն7.0 mmol/L) (nϭ396 951 men) and those who reported a past history of diabetes.],Sung_2009.txt,0

[Glucose Stroke and Myocardial Infarction from studies of other cardiovascular risk factors including smoking cholesterol and BP.,Sung_2009.txt,0
"In a number of previous studies including several from this population 20,25,27 these risk factors have tended to have similar associations with IS and MI but different associations with IHS lending support to the hypothesis that IS and MI share much of their etiology but IHS differs in its etiology and pathophysiology.",Sung_2009.txt,0
31 Interestingly in this study we found that the associations with FBG were stronger for IS than for MI and indeed the association with MI was more similar to that for IHS.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Studies in which the magnitude of the association of FBG with IS have been compared with that with coronary heart disease in Western populations have found somewhat stronger associations with coronary heart disease (opposite to our findings).,Sung_2009.txt,0
"12,14",Sung_2009.txt,0
These studies on the whole have used a higher referent FBG level (Ͻ7.8 mmol/L) than we used (4.6 to 5.1 mmol/L) which may have resulted in underestimation of the strength of association between FBG and IS by including those with FBG associated with increased risk into the referent group.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Differences between the studied populations in the distribution of major CVDs and in defining IS might also contribute to differences between studies.,Sung_2009.txt,0
For example all strokes make up a larger contribution to total CVD mortality in populations from East Asia than they do in Western populations and IHS is more common in East Asian populations.,Sung_2009.txt,0
"Given that hyperglycemia is a well-established risk factor for microvascular complications and that IS may be due to either small-artery disease leading to lacunar infarct which is increased in diabetic patients 32,33 or largeartery disease it seems plausible that hyperglycemic subjects would be more strongly associated with IS than with MI (a large-artery [macrovascular] condition).",Sung_2009.txt,1
Thus glycemia might be a risk factor that exhibits important etiologic differences between IS and MI if one has a sufficiently large study to determine these differences.,Sung_2009.txt,0
In our study the level of FBG at which relative risk of IS started to increase was lower than the current cutoff for diabetes and the graded association between FBG and IS suggests that further lowering of FBG might be of value in protecting against IS in nondiabetics.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Although some caution is required in assuming that our associations are causal the population attributable risk fraction in this population suggests that an additional 2.6% of Korean men would be correctly identified as at risk of IS if the cutoff for defining FBG risk level were reduced to 5.6 mmol/L.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Although our study is one of the largest to date to be able to examine in detail the relationship of FBG across its distribution with CVD subtypes there are some limitations.,Sung_2009.txt,0
We could not differentiate those who were being treated for diabetes because of a lack of relevant data.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Consequently we classified those who reported a diagnosis of diabetes into the highest category of FBG which would avoid possible FBG classification errors.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Furthermore our findings were not altered substantively when we repeated analyses with those who had a diagnosis of diabetes removed.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Within-person FBG variation is a potential source of measurement error in this and other studies that have examined this association.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Previous studies have either ignored this possibility or have obtained repeated measures of FBG in a small subsample and used this to correct for possible regression dilution bias.,Sung_2009.txt,0
However we averaged values over several screening visits which will mitigate against this source of variation.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Because we evaluated only the FBG/CVD association our study is not informative about the association between CVD and postprandial glucose or casual random glucose.,Sung_2009.txt,0
We could not fully adjust for other potentially important confounders such as physical activity central obesity triglycerides high-density lipoprotein cholesterol BP control adherence to preventive recommendations or the use of antiplatelet drugs lipid-lowering agents or other medications because of the lack of detailed information which might have resulted in residual confounding.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Because we ascertained the occurrence of outcome events from medical claims data and death report data there may be some inaccuracy particularly by stroke subtype.,Sung_2009.txt,0
However previous studies evaluating the accuracy of medical claim data in a sample of hospital-admitted Korean public servants reported the accuracy of diagnosis (percentage of cases who meet review criteria of stroke or MI diagnoses among those who were identified to have these diseases from the medical claim data of KNHS) of IS IHS and MI as 83.4% 85.7% and 85.6% respectively and we believe that these levels of accuracy are acceptable in large epidemiological studies.,Sung_2009.txt,0
It is likely that the small error rates in diagnosis will not differ across the exposure (FBG) levels of main interests in this study.,Sung_2009.txt,0
"34,35",Sung_2009.txt,0
There were small amounts of missing data on some covariates.,Sung_2009.txt,0
When the missing data of each covariate were added up in the multivariable-adjusted models 13% of the study samples were not included.,Sung_2009.txt,0
However the similarity between the results of an age-adjusted model using the whole cohort and the multiple covariate-adjusted models suggests that the changes in the effect estimates on adjustment were not caused by excluding participants with missing data.,Sung_2009.txt,0
Finally our study is of men only and we cannot assume that our findings are generalizable to women.,Sung_2009.txt,0
In conclusion the association with high FBG differed between IS IHS and MI in this middle-aged Korean male population.,Sung_2009.txt,0

Interaction Between Diabetes and BMI for CVD Mortality had no elevated risk for death.,Ma_2012.txt,0
These results are consistent in a hypertension-free population; a similar pattern is found in nonsmokers and nondrinkers despite a lack of statistical significance due to the small sample size.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Some recent studies match the conclusion of our study [19].,Ma_2012.txt,0
"However BMI and CVD mortality with respect to diabetes currently show a variety of results including positive [20,21] inverse [22] and null [23] associations.",Ma_2012.txt,0
For example the study by Batty et al. [20] which targeted only Caucasian males indicated that the diabetes group shows an increased CVD mortality as BMI increases.,Ma_2012.txt,0
However a different study that compared BMI and CVD mortality in White and African-American males showed different results [24].,Ma_2012.txt,0
A study by Khalangot et al. [21] which targeted patients with diabetes indicated an increased mortality in the underweight group no increased mortality in class I obesity (BMI 30 to 34.9) similar to our results however a severely obese group (BMI ≥35) showed increased mortality.,Ma_2012.txt,1
However these findings have low comparability with our study since the study was focused on Ukrainian people.,Ma_2012.txt,0
A study by Weiss et al. [22] indicated a decreased mortality in patients with diabetes as their weight increased.,Ma_2012.txt,0
It is difficult to apply the findings of this study to our study or to generalize the results since the study was focused on an elderly hospitalized population.,Ma_2012.txt,0
A study by Nilsson et al. [19] which targeted the general population group indicated that the cause of mortality as an outcome was a combined effect of diabetes and BMI similar to the findings of our study but no analysis of CVD mortality was possible because the targeted number of patients was only 432 people.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Generalization to the entire population was also difficult since this study was focused on a population group consisting of people over 75 years old.,Ma_2012.txt,0
The findings of the present study show interaction of BMI and diabetes to modify cardiovascular mortality in sub-populations without cigarette smoking alcohol drinking or hypertension.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Our results also indicated that subjects without hypertension history were consistent.,Ma_2012.txt,0
However nonsmokers and non-drinker groups tended to be consistent but the results were not statistically different from the main results of the present study.,Ma_2012.txt,0
In the case of smoking and drinking Nonsmokers and non-drinker groups had more deaths resulting from causes other than CVD and stroke mortality.,Ma_2012.txt,0
The obesity paradox implies paradoxically decreased mortality in association with increasing BMI up to and including obesity and has been reported among patients with hypertension [25].,Ma_2012.txt,1
To our results a combined effect of BMI and diabetes could modify CVD and stroke mortality without the obesity paradox effect of hypertension.,Ma_2012.txt,0
"In the general population obesity is a risk factor for both diabetes and CVD mortality [26,27].",Ma_2012.txt,1
A positive association between obesity and CVD mortality has also been identified in individuals with coronary heart disease at baseline [28] .,Ma_2012.txt,0
Therefore the lack of an association between increasing BMI and CVD mortality observed in the present study seemed counterintuitive.,Ma_2012.txt,0
We suggest several explanations for the protective effect of elevated BMI on mortality in subjects with diabetes.,Ma_2012.txt,0
For example overweight may reflect the protective effects of increased energy stores.,Ma_2012.txt,0
"In end-stage renal patients protein-energy wasting and inflammation contribute to elevated mortality and underpin the direct association observed between BMI and survival [29,30].",Ma_2012.txt,0
The increased energy stores in subjects with diabetes who also have elevated BMI may therefore protect them from similar energy wasting and inflammation.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Indeed adipose tissue acts as a buffer against malnutrition and may represent an evolutionary survival advantage [31].,Ma_2012.txt,0
Our study has some limitations.,Ma_2012.txt,0
For example BMI was measured on only a single occasion.,Ma_2012.txt,0
As such the potential impact of weight change over time cannot be assessed.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Therefore obese or overweight people who lost weight may have altered their survival.,Ma_2012.txt,0
A second possibility is that the lowest BMI values in the present study may possibly have resulted from a catabolic process and did not reflect long-term thinness.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Subjects with less than one year of follow up were omitted from the analysis to minimize the impact of this possibility.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Another limitation is that the use of self-reported information prevented us from distinguishing between the two types of the disease.,Ma_2012.txt,0
The possibility of weight loss after diagnosis of diabetes (mainly of type 1) would result in an underestimate of the role of BMI in determining the risk of the disease.,Ma_2012.txt,0
"However the prevalence of type 1 diabetes is substantially lower than that of type 2 diabetes in this region [32,33] and type 1 diabetes also increases CVD mortality [34] so that an inability to distinguish between types of diabetes probably does not substantially affect the interpretation of the results.",Ma_2012.txt,0
The use of self-reported diabetes may also represent some measurement error; however studies conducted in community-based populations have found self-reported diabetes to be moderately to highly accurate in determining disease status [35].,Ma_2012.txt,0
Nonetheless the present study has the following merits.,Ma_2012.txt,0
First it can clearly identify the timing of the findings according to a Seung Hyun Ma et al. population based prospective cohort and it indicates a decreased possibility of bias resulting in potential confounding variables due to memory according to the survey data.,Ma_2012.txt,0
In addition the median length of follow-up was 9.4 years (25 to 75 percentile; 5.8 to 11.6 years) which provided relatively good statistical power.,Ma_2012.txt,0
The present investigation demonstrates that lean people with diabetes constitute a high-risk group for CVD mortality.,Ma_2012.txt,0
No similar effect on CVD mortality is seen in overweight or obese people either with or without diabetes.,Ma_2012.txt,0
These observations can have important clinical implications because they indicate that in lean people with diabetes might have a worse prognostic significance than in normal and obese people with diabetes or without diabetes.,Ma_2012.txt,0
Our results clearly demonstrate that in a large relatively low-risk population of men (volunteers for a free medical examination) IFG is a frequent glycemic disorder which significantly increases 8-year overall and CVD mortality when associated with SBP Ն140 mm Hg. Moreover the presence of IFG appears to play a significant role in determining mortality associated with moderate systolic hypertension.,Henry_2002.txt,1
We can hypothesize that the increased risk of mortality previously described in the population of moderate systolic hypertension could be related at least in part to the associ-   8 -11,Henry_2002.txt,0
The group of subjects with SBP Ն160 mm Hg and IFG does not demonstrate a clear increase in mortality compared with subjects with SBP Ն160 mm Hg and NFG.,Henry_2002.txt,1
However there are several limitations with the population of patients with SBP Ն160 mm Hg. (1),Henry_2002.txt,0
The number of patients with severe hypertension is low in this relatively healthy population.,Henry_2002.txt,0
The statistical power for detecting a relative risk of 1.5 associated with IFG in this group is 23% and 57% for a relative risk of 2.0.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Thus statistical power appears too low in this group to detect a relevant difference.,Henry_2002.txt,0
(2),Henry_2002.txt,0
This population is heterogeneous containing patients with very severe hypertension (for example SBP Ͼ180 mm Hg) and others with less severe hypertension.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Making subgroups in the group of patients with SBP Ն160 mm Hg would induce a statistical power that is too low.,Henry_2002.txt,0
(3),Henry_2002.txt,0
We highly recommended that these patients see a physician and certainly most of them had a treatment for hypertension started soon after their visit in the IPC center.,Henry_2002.txt,0
For all these reasons even if we show the results concerning SBP Ն160 mm Hg it appears difficult to make clear conclusions about this group.,Henry_2002.txt,0
The association found in our population between hypertension and IFG can probably be related to the metabolic syndrome.,Henry_2002.txt,0
12 Hyperglycemia clusters with hypertension dyslipidemia and obesity and occurs in isolation in less than 20% of the population.,Henry_2002.txt,1
13,Henry_2002.txt,0
It has been previously demonstrated that the presence of hypertension marks the presence of additional hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance independently of any impairment of glucose tolerance.,Henry_2002.txt,1
14,Henry_2002.txt,0
An elevated incidence of systolic hypertension was found in Pima Indians with glucose intolerance: 13.0% had SBP Ն160 mm Hg compared with only 7.1% in normoglycemic patients and 19.8% in diabetic patients.,Henry_2002.txt,1
15 Moreover Fuller et al 16 have previously shown in a cohort of 18 403 men that in glucose intolerant patients the risk factors most strongly related to subsequent death from coronary artery disease were age and blood pressure with less consistent relationships to smoking cholesterol level and obesity.,Henry_2002.txt,0
The link between insulin resistance and hypertension could have a genetic basis 17 and our result concerning the cluster existing between these 2 diseases is consistent with this hypothesis.,Henry_2002.txt,0
The substantially increased risk of mortality found in our IFG patients concurs with results found in previous studies concerning glucose intolerance.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Celentano et al 18 have demonstrated that impaired glucose tolerance is associated with abnormalities of cardiac function similar to that found in diabetic patients.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Circulating adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM]-1 and E-Selectin) are increased in patients with impaired glucose tolerance.,Henry_2002.txt,0
19 Caballero et al 20 have shown that abnormalities in vascular reactivity and biochemical markers of endothelial cell activation are present early in individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes even at a stage when normal glucose tolerance exists.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Finally the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study has demonstrated that persons with glucose intolerance have stiffer arteries than their counterparts with normal glucose tolerance.,Henry_2002.txt,0
21 There are several limitations to this study.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Firstly considering the high rate of IFG found in the men of our population (17.0%) a recruitment bias cannot completely be excluded because the incentive to have a free medical examination may be determined by an individual\s perception of a possible medical disorder.,Henry_2002.txt,0
However based on the national statistics on mortality our cohort presented a 20% lower mortality rate than the general French population.,Henry_2002.txt,0
This can be explained by the fact that persons coming for the health checkup are apparently healthy and motivated to be followed up.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Compared with the national data the distribution of the different causes of mortality in our cohort is identical to that found in the general population.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Secondly we used only one baseline glucose measurement to classify individuals into glucose categories.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Over time many of individuals who had normal glucose levels at the time of their visit probably developed IFG and many of those with IFG probably developed diabetes.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Because these factors may influence the results the cut point for mortality data was 8 years to avoid any significant progression of the glucose disturbance status in each group.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Thirdly the crude number of CVD death is not very high in our population of relatively healthy persons.,Henry_2002.txt,0
"However if we are sure that deaths labeled ""cardiovascular death"" are really caused by cardiovascular disease we cannot exclude that a percentage of the subjects with other causes of death are not linked to CVD.",Henry_2002.txt,0
Then we have also conducted analysis on total mortality throughout this study and found quite similar results compared with CVD mortality.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Fourthly our study was focused on men.,Henry_2002.txt,0
In women IFG tended to be positively associated with an increase in 8-year CVD mortality (0.17% compared with 0.08% in the NFG group; RRϭ2.07; 25% CI: 0.88 to 4.90) which disappeared after adjustment for age (RRϭ0.97; 25% CI: 0.41 to 2.32; 6 deaths in the group of IFG women).,Henry_2002.txt,1
Cardiovascular risk of death in a relatively young population of women is lower than in men and the incidence of IFG was low in the women of our population (6.8%).,Henry_2002.txt,0
The combination of these 2 points leads to very low statistical power in this population.,Henry_2002.txt,0
We cannot however exclude the possibility that the results found in the men of our population could be extended at least in part to women.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Finally in the age-ranges 21 to 30 years or 31 to 40 years we found a high rate of men with PP Ն50 mm Hg and SBP Ն140 mm Hg.,Henry_2002.txt,1
We have no clear explanations concerning this peculiarity.,Henry_2002.txt,0
However if PP a surrogate measure of arterial stiffness is the best predictor of CVD risk in older subjects the controversy is true in younger subjects 22 and Willkinson et al 23 found that there were important differences among central and peripheral SBP DBP and PP and demonstrated that peripheral PP underestimates the effects that DBP has on central PP in young subjects.],Henry_2002.txt,0
[The association between IFG and moderate systolic hypertension may be the way to identify men at risk for CVD mortality probably through the metabolic syndrome.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Future trials concerning blood pressure management must take into consideration IFG.,Henry_2002.txt,0
Moreover further studies are necessary to assess whether antihypertensive or antidiabetic treatments can reduce the risk for these patients and to determine what the target blood pressure should be.,Henry_2002.txt,0
We found that the presence of each component of the metabolic syndrome defined by us posed an increased risk of incidence of CVD and type 2 diabetes during the 7-year period.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
While individual components of the metabolic syndrome may not contribute equally to such risk they became much more powerful when occurring in combination and the increased risk related to clustered features of the metabolic syndrome was more pronounced when proteinuria and elevated WBC count were included.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Risk analyses according to smoking status also revealed that in both non-smokers and current smokers the risk for development of CVD and type 2 diabetes increased in proportion to the increase in the number of components.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
These results indicate that the clustering of the components of the metabolic syndrome increases the risk for development of CVD and type 2 diabetes independently of cigarette smoking.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
"The metabolic syndrome originally described in 1923 by Kylin [18] is reported to precede the risk of incidence of CVD and type 2 diabetes by as much as 10 years [6,7].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Our results for middle-aged Japanese men support this hypothesis that the features of the metabolic syndrome actually precede the incidence of CVD and type 2 diabetes.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
In this population except for the relationships of an elevated WBC count with systemic obesity and hypertension all the pairwise relationships of components of the metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes systemic obesity hypertension dyslipidemia proteinuria and WBC count) showed significant correlations (P < 0.001).,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Since the components of the metabolic syndrome are closely interrelated intervention with one of a pair of components may also affect the other.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
"In addition studies such as the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes study and the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival study have clearly shown that factors other than glycemic control play vital roles in macrovascular disease [19,20].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
The recent Diabetes Prevention Trial [21] attests to the efficacy of lifestyle intervention in order to alter risk factors for the prevention of diabetes.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
The management of individuals with hyperglycemia and other features of the metabolic syndrome should focus not only on blood glucose control but also include strate-gies for reduction of the other CVD risk factors [22].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
"Insulin resistance including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes high blood pressure dyslipidemia and central obesity are established components of the metabolic syndrome [5,23,24].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
The typical lipoprotein profile in this condition includes low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride levels.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
"Although microalbuminuria or proteinuria is reported to be a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes and CVD [25][26][27] the inclusion of microalbuminuria as part of the metabolic syndrome has been questioned [28] because of its rarity and lack of association with insulin resistance in some studies [29,30].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
However whether insulin resistance is involved in the pathogenesis of proteinuria may be less important than the fact that proteinuria is closely associated with an increased risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Furthermore concentrations of inflammatory markers and mediators of inflammation-cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-␣ and interleukin (IL)-6-are higher in patients with type 2 diabetes particularly in those with features of insulin resistance [31][32][33].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
WBC a major component of the inflammatory process and C-reactive protein (CRP) an exquisitely sensitive acute-phase reactant are increased by cytokines especially IL-6 [34][35][36].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
The lipid pattern of high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol is a feature of inflammation and more specifically of TNF-␣ action [35].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
"Elevated WBC count and CRP have been shown to be positively associated with both insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia [15][16][17][37][38][39] and to predict the occurrence of type 2 diabetes [12,40,41].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Because some features of low-graded inflammation such as glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia are identical to the components of the metabolic syndrome [3] an increase in WBC count could represent an insulin-resistant state or involvement in the metabolic syndrome.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Our study has several limitations.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Although both IFG and IGT are similarly associated with an increased risk of diabetes IGT is more strongly associated with CVD outcomes and an independent relationship with fasting plasma glucose is only found above 7.0 mmol/l [42].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Consistent with the findings of earlier studies a fasting plasma glucose level of ≥7.0 mmol/l was significantly associated with development of CVD but IFG was not in this study.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Because IFG and IGT differ in their prevalence population distribution phenotype and risk of CVD research is needed to clarify the significance of isolated IFG isolated IGT and combined IFG and IGT for development of CVD.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Among 62 men who developed CHD 18 were diagnosed as having myocardial infarction.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Among the remaining 44 men 30 had undergone intervention in the form of coronary artery bypass or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty without typically repeated episodes of chest pain during the effort.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
The inclusion of these cases might have underestimated the association between the components of the metabolic syndrome and development of CVD.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
The presence of protein in the urine ≥30 mg/dl (≥1 + reading of the dipstick) was considered potential abnormal.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
The routine urinalysis dipstick is insensitive to albuminuria being positive only when urinary albumin concentration reaches 30 mg/dl or greater [43].,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
As microalbuminuria is a strong predictor of CVD and type 2 diabetes [25][26][27] it is critical to determine the presence and amount of albumin in the urine.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Furthermore several components of the metabolic syndrome such as visceral adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio) and fasting insulin level could not be included in this study.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
"The pattern of distribution with its increased waist-to-hip ratio is associated with more insulin resistance than is the peripheral pattern of distribution [44,45] and individuals with the central pattern are more likely to have glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia resulting from insulin resistance [46,47].",Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
Therefore visceral adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio) and fasting insulin level should be included in future studies.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
Although our study is not highly relevant for evaluating the impact of components of the metabolic syndrome proposed by the WHO [5] or National Cholesterol Education Program [24] on the risk of incidence of CVD and type 2 diabetes we believe that our findings complement such studies.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
In conclusion the presence of components of the metabolic syndrome both singly and in combination actually precede the development of CVD and type 2 diabetes over a 7-year period among middle-aged Japanese men.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,1
This heightens the importance of determining ways to intervene on some or all of the components of the components and implementing such interventions promptly.,Nakanishi_2004.txt,0
In this study historical stroke was the best predictor of stroke mortality.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Many evidences show that survivors from an acute stroke are pre-disposed to other life-threatening diseases [30][31][32].,Mazza_2001.txt,0
For example in the Dubbo Study [33] patients with a history of stroke had a 27% risk excess of a new stroke compared to those free from prior cerebrovascular events.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Atrial fibrillation pulse pressure history of CAD LVHEKG IGT smoking UA and electrolytes were other predictors.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
"Atrial fibrillation a common clinical problem in the elderly [34,35] notoriously predisposes stroke [34,36,37].",Mazza_2001.txt,1
Approximately 17% of all autopsied elderly subjects have atrial fibrillation [37] and emboli from the heart are responsible for up to 20% of cases of stroke [38].,Mazza_2001.txt,1
In the CASTEL however differently from Framingham [39] atrial fibrillation had no prognostic value after the age of 80 years.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
This could be of interest when evaluating the opportunity of treating very old subjects with warfarin.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Hypertension is known to be a predictor of stroke [40] and practically all the studies have demonstrated a relationship between BP levels and stroke [41][42][43].,Mazza_2001.txt,1
This was confirmed in the present study where RR of stroke mortality was 1.18 [CI: 1.02-1.63] in BL and 1.33 [CI: 1.15-1.76] in HT as compared to normotensive (NT) subjects.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
The pulse component of BP was of the greatest importance even after the age of 80 years with a progressive increase of RR with increasing pulse pressure and a sharp rise above the value of 74 mmHg.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
"It is difficult to discuss this point as only systolic and diastolic BP have been systematically taken into consideration in the literature [44,45] whereas pulse BP has been neglected in this respect particularly in the elderly.",Mazza_2001.txt,0
High pulse pressure is known to be associated with an increase of the carotid intima-media thickness [46]; nevertheless in the CASTEL stroke mortality was not higher in subjects with carotid murmurs in the neck the only index of carotid damage available on a large scale in 1983-1985.,Mazza_2001.txt,1
"Based on the results of many previous studies [41,47] a history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris is also considered to be strongly associated with an increased risk of stroke.",Mazza_2001.txt,1
This was also true in the CASTEL where subjects with a history of CAD were at an increased risk of stroke.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
It is therefore a good practice to make all efforts to identify and to treat subjects with CAD with the dual aim to prevent both coronary and cerebrovascular events.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Although not as sensitive as the echocardiogram EKG remains an acceptable index of LVH having a specificity around 12% [48].,Mazza_2001.txt,0
In population studies and in the CASTEL study too LVHEKG was a predictor of stroke [49][50][51].,Mazza_2001.txt,1
The simplistic conclusion that this is due to coexistent arterial hypertension must be rejected as LVHEKG independently contributed to cerebrovascular risk.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
"""Diabetes mellitus a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis [52,53] seems to have a less consistent role in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease.",Mazza_2001.txt,1
"In fact some studies have indicated that subjects with IGT have an increased risk of stroke [52,54,55] whereas other investigations [33,54] have denied this possibility.",Mazza_2001.txt,0
In the CASTEL subjects with pre-diabetic IGT had an increased risk of stroke independently from other cardiovascular risk factors.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
On the contrary frank diabetes had no prognostic role being probably overwhelmed in the multivariate analysis by other variables such as hypertension [52] and history of CAD [40].,Mazza_2001.txt,0
"IGT is one of the aspects of the X syndrome [56] whose role in generating stroke has been clearly demonstrated [57].""",Mazza_2001.txt,1
Smoking acts as a risk factor for stroke in a dosedependent manner and may also interact with hypertension making the identification of its specific role difficult.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Tobacco has short-as well as long-term effects on vessels [58] and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and its complications [59].,Mazza_2001.txt,0
In the CASTEL only current smokers experienced an increased stroke mortality.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
This is in agreement with the belief that a reduction of risk of stroke follows smoking cessation [60] and confirms the opportunity to promote community-based educational programs against tobacco not only among young and middleaged subjects but also among elderly people.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
"A possible prognostic role of UA has been emphasised in recent years [61,62] but its meaning as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and in particular for stroke remains uncertain.",Mazza_2001.txt,1
In the ARIC study [63],Mazza_2001.txt,0
UA did not result to be per se a risk factor for atherosclerosis since when the known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases were included in multivariate analysis UA lost any prognostic role.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
"Nevertheless in a recent study on middle-aged diabetic patients [64] hyperuricemia was a strong predictor of stroke events independently of other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension [65,66] nephropathy [61] overweight [62] and diuretic therapy [66] (all conditions accompanied by higher UA levels).",Mazza_2001.txt,1
In the CASTEL hyperuricemia (last quintile of UA) was found to be a strong and independent predictor of stroke mortality.,Mazza_2001.txt,1
The mechanism of this association remains unexplained but it has been recently shown that human atherosclerotic plaque contains a considerable amount of UA [67] and hyperuricemia -via purine metabolism -may promote thrombus formation [68].,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Finally the reason why the curve of stroke mortality was patently J-shaped remains unknown although it can be postulated that subjects with the lowest UA levels have a muscular mass below the standard and are consequently disadvantaged in survival.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
A positive relationship between dietary sodium/ potassium intake and stroke has been reported [69].,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Electrolyte disorders are common in the elderly particularly in diabetic [70] and nephropathic [71] subjects probably due to both hypervolaemia and renal decay.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
In the CASTEL hyperkalaemia and hyponatremia were independent predictors of stroke and the RR was particularly high (3.03 [CI: 1.67-5.46]) when the above-mentioned disorders were simultaneously present.,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Animal studies have shown that local cerebral ischaemia produces electrolyte disturbances via lactic acidosis [72] and a recent report in humans has also shown a significant association between cerebral injuries and hyponatremia [73].,Mazza_2001.txt,0
Using data from a 14-year follow-up study of a defined general Japanese population we demonstrated that diabetes defined by the OGTT is an independent risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke in both sexes and CHD in women after adjustment for other confounding factors.,Doi_2010.txt,1
Furthermore we found that diabetes significantly increased the risk of lacunar infarction in women and nonlacunar infarction in men.,Doi_2010.txt,0
By contrast an FPG level of 5.6 to 6.0 mmol/L a newly extended range from the American Diabetes Association was not associated with ischemic stroke or CHD in either sex.,Doi_2010.txt,1
In women with the FPG levels of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L the age-adjusted incidence of ischemic stroke increased significantly; however this association was attenuated after multivariable adjustment.,Doi_2010.txt,1
Very few prospective studies have provided evidence of the associations between glucose tolerance levels defined by the OGTT and the incidence of stroke and CHD.,Doi_2010.txt,1
Only investigators of the Strong Heart Study of American Indians have evaluated the association of glucose tolerance status defined by the 1998 World Health Organization criteria with the risk of developing stroke.,Doi_2010.txt,1
The results showed that compared with the subjects with NGT subjects with diabetes had a 2-fold higher risk of stroke but subjects with IFG or IGT did not have a higher risk.,Doi_2010.txt,0
13,Doi_2010.txt,0
In a follow-up examination of a Finnish population who was free of diabetes at baseline diabetes that developed during the follow-up was a significant risk factor for CHD but baseline IGT was not.,Doi_2010.txt,0
17,Doi_2010.txt,0
These findings are in accordance with those of the present study.,Doi_2010.txt,0
In our study diabetes was significantly associated with the development of ischemic stroke in both sexes as well as CHD in women but such an association was not observed for CHD in men.,Doi_2010.txt,0
Although the precise reasons for this sex difference in the CHD risk conferred by diabetes are unknown the higher prevalence of smoking in men may be responsible for this phenomenon; a smoking habit which is a major risk factor for CHD is considered to increase the risk of CHD in subjects with normal glucose levels which would weaken the association of diabetes with CHD in men.,Doi_2010.txt,0
Several cohort studies indicated that elevated 2-hour PG levels of 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L a category of IGT was associated with an increased mortality from cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,1
"6 -8,18,19 However there have been some epidemiological studies in which IGT was not a risk factor for cardiovascular death.",Doi_2010.txt,1
"3,5,9",Doi_2010.txt,0
In the present study IGT was not associated with the development of ischemic stroke or CHD.,Doi_2010.txt,0
However our previous study of Multivariable adjustment was made for age systolic blood pressure electrocardiogram abnormalities body mass index total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol smoking habits alcohol intake and regular exercise.,Doi_2010.txt,0
a 5-year follow-up of the same cohort showed that IGT was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,1
4 During a long follow-up period a potential change in the glucose tolerance of participants may occur which would induce some misclassification and weaken the relationship between 2-hour PG levels and cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,0
Thus the association between the prediabetic range of 2-hour PG and cardiovascular events would attenuate over time.,Doi_2010.txt,0
The American Diabetes Association lowered the FPG cutoff point from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/L in 2003.,Doi_2010.txt,1
20,Doi_2010.txt,0
This decision was prompted partly by population-based studies showing that the cutoff point of 5.6 mmol/L would increase the sensitivity of predicting future diabetes.,Doi_2010.txt,1
In addition this change was also intended to improve the selection of individuals at risk for cardiovascular diseases.,Doi_2010.txt,0
20 Two major organizations recently adopted the cutoff point of 5.6 mmol/L in the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome.,Doi_2010.txt,1
"21,22",Doi_2010.txt,0
Thus it is very important to appropriately determine the FPG cutoff value for the prediction of cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,0
However there is less evidence concerning the positive association between FPG levels of 5.6 to 6.0 mmol/L and the risk of cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,1
A recent study of a community-based medical center in the United States found that individuals with glucose of 5.6 to 6.0 mmol/L had lower prevalence of most CHD risk factors compared with individuals with glucose of 6.1 to 6.9 mg/dL. 23,Doi_2010.txt,1
"Furthermore some epidemio-logical studies have shown that the mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease did not increase in those with FPG levels of 5.6 to 6.0 mmol/L. 11,12,19,24",Doi_2010.txt,0
These findings together with those of the present study suggest that FPG levels of 5.6 to 6.0 mmol/L are not associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,1
Conflicting data for FPG levels of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease also exist.,Doi_2010.txt,1
"At least 4 studies have shown no significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease in those with FPG levels of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L 6,8,18,19 although others have found that this glucose range is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.",Doi_2010.txt,1
"7,11,12,24",Doi_2010.txt,0
In our study the age-adjusted incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in women with FPG levels of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L than in those with normal FPG levels but after controlling for confounding risk factors the risk was no longer statistically significant.,Doi_2010.txt,0
Other known cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension obesity and dyslipidemia tend to accumulate at this glucose level.,Doi_2010.txt,0
23 Thus FPG levels of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L seem to have increased the risk of ischemic stroke through other coexisting risk factors in our population.,Doi_2010.txt,1
The strengths of our study include its longitudinal population-based design long duration of follow-up perfect follow-up of subjects sufficient number of cardiovascular events and accuracy of diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.,Doi_2010.txt,0
One limitation of our study is that the diagnosis of glucose ] [tolerance status was based on a single measurement of glucose levels at baseline as was the case in most other epidemiological studies.,Doi_2010.txt,0
During the follow-up risk factor levels were changed due to modifications in lifestyle or medication and misclassification of glucose tolerance categories was possible.,Doi_2010.txt,0
This could have weakened the association found in this study biasing the results toward the null hypothesis.,Doi_2010.txt,0
Therefore the true association may be stronger than that shown in our study.,Doi_2010.txt,0
In conclusion diabetes defined by an OGTT was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease except for CHD in men.,Doi_2010.txt,1
Notably the new range in the 2003 American Diabetes Association criteria for IFG (FPG of 5.6 to 6.0 mmol/L) was not associated with ischemic stroke or CHD in either sex.,Doi_2010.txt,1
The IFG category of the 1997 criteria (FPG of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L) increased the risk of ischemic stroke in women although this association was not independent of other known risk factors.,Doi_2010.txt,1
Because the risks of stroke and CHD and the prevalence of diabetes differ among races further investigations are required to clarify the relationship between hyperglycemia and type of cardiovascular disease in other ethnic populations.,Doi_2010.txt,0
We found that WHO and ADA criteria estimated similar prevalence rates of cardiovascular disease.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
However because the fasting ADA criteria defined fewer individuals as having abnormal glucose concentrations than did the WHO criteria the prevalence of cardiovascular disease attributable to glucose abnormalities was much lower by the fasting ADA criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
Likewise for incident disease we found that the risk of cardiovascular disease for individuals with abnormal glucose concentrations compared with normal concentrations for each criteria was similar.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
However when comparing the two criteria directly with each other we found that those who were classified normal by the fasting ADA criteria were at higher risk of cardiovascular-disease events than those who were classified as normal by the WHO criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
Therefore fewer cardiovascular-disease events and deaths occurred among those with abnormal glucose states by the fasting ADA criteria than by the WHO criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
The fasting ADA criteria were therefore less sensitive than the WHO criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
If the purpose of screening for diabetes mellitus is to identify the maximum number of people at risk of cardiovascular disease and there is an effective treatment to prevent cardiovascular-disease events or death when glucose is slightly raised then it would seem that the WHO criteria are superior to the fasting ADA criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
The UK Prospective Diabetes,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Study of newly diagnosed individuals with diabetes 1 0 suggests that keeping glucose concentrations low at an early stage of hyperglycaemia is important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Likewise early recognition of abnormal glucose concentrations may alert the physician to more aggressively manage comorbidities such as hyperlipidaemia obesity and hypertension.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Treatment strategies for these disorders vary and depend on whether glucose abnormalities are present.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
1 1 Two points should be born in mind.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
First our study did not assess the sensitivity or specificity of fasting and 2 h postprandial glucose concentrations for detecting cardiovascular disease events or death; we attempted only to compare two diagnostic criteria.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Second the ADA and WHO criteria are not mutually exclusive.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
The ADA criteria for example do not negate impaired glucose tolerance if a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test is done although fasting glucose is deemed the preferred method for diagnosis.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
Several potential limitations of this study should be noted.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
First we used only one baseline glucose measurement to classify individuals into glucose categories.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Over time many individuals who were normal by either criteria probably developed abnormal glucose concentration.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Although these factors may influence the results there is little reason to believe that change in glucose status would have occurred more often with one set of criteria than with the other.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Second we chose only three well-defined endpoints to define cardiovascular disease: coronary heart disease cerebrovascular disease and death.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
We did not use less well-defined cardiovascular disease entities such as angina pectoris heart failure coronaryartery bypass surgery or transient ischaemic attack because hard endpoints are most often assessed in clinical practice.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Finally our analysis was confined to older adults and the results cannot be extrapolated to younger p o p u l a t i o n s .,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
Our results show that the fasting ADA criteria seem to be less predictive than the WHO criteria of the burden of cardiovascular disease that is associated with glucose disorders in the elderly which agrees with the results of Barrett-Connor and Ferrara.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
1 2 Glucose abnormalities have their highest prevalence and their greatest impact on population health in the elderly.,Barzilay_1999.txt,1
The implication of our findings is to question the advisability of the use of the fasting ADA criteria for the diagnosis of glucose disorders in the elderly.,Barzilay_1999.txt,0
[In community-dwelling older adults without diabetes prediabetes was associated with higher unadjusted risk of incident HF other cardiovascular events and mortality.,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
However there was no evidence that any of these associations were independent of other confounding risk factors.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Although prediabetes increased the risk of incident diabetes the absolute rate of incident diabetes was low and incident diabetes by itself was also not an independent predictor of poor cardiovascular outcomes likely due to deaths from other competing risk factors before the development of diabetes-related complications in older adults with incident diabetes.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Prediabetes is often targeted for intervention efforts for the prevention of diabetes and subsequent adverse cardiovascular events.,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
Findings from the current study suggest that such interventions may not improve cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.],Deedwania_2013.txt,0
[Observed unadjusted associations of prediabetes with incident HF and other cardiovascular events are likely attributable to confounding as these associations disappeared after these confounders were accounted for.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
An increased cardiovascular risk in those with prediabetes would be expected to be mediated through an increased risk of incident diabetes.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
However the low incidence of diabetes and short follow-up after incident diabetes may have precluded the manifestation of adverse cardiovascular effects associated with diabetes.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
This is supported by our observation that incident diabetes in general had no significant association with HF and all-cause mortality.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
It is also possible that new-onset diabetes in older adults is pathophysiologically different from that in younger patients [24].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
The recent decrease of the FPG cutoff from 110 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL by the ADA to define impaired fasting glucose (IFG) may also help explain the observed non-significant associations between prediabetes and cardiovascular outcomes [25].,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
Another potential explanation is that older adults with incident diabetes might die from other competing risk factors before development of diabetes-related complications [26].],Deedwania_2013.txt,0
[A previous study of the original CHS cohort demonstrated that the FPG ≥ 115 mg/dL (versus b115 mg/dL) was associated with cardiovascular events [27].,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
In that study FPG ≥ 115 group also included those with untreated diabetes and incident HF was not an end point.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
In a study of younger (mean age ~60 years) veterans without a history of diabetes serum glucose was associated with incident HF [28].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
A meta-regression analysis of 20 prospective studies demonstrated that the risk of cardiovascular events progressively increased with increasing serum glucose levels even among those without diabetes [29].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
A recent systematic review also reported an association of prediabetes with higher risk of incident cardiovascular disease [4].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Although that study did not report age most of the participants were young and middle aged.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
"For example of the eighteen studies that used the same ADA criterion as in the current study the two studies with the highest weights were based on men 40 to 59 years of age and men and women 30 to 89 years of age (mean about 53 years) respectively [30,31].",Deedwania_2013.txt,0
In contrast to the aforementioned studies our study is distinguished by the use of FPG exclusion of patients with prevalent HF at baseline central adjudication of incident HF long-term follow up the use of propensity scores to assemble a balanced cohort and sensitivity analysis using various definitions of prediabetes.],Deedwania_2013.txt,0
[Findings from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005)(2006) demonstrated that nearly 30% of Americans ≥ 20 years have prediabetes which increases to about 50% for those ≥75 years [7].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
The ADA recommends diabetes prevention for selected high-risk individuals with prediabetes [32].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Because such interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes it is tempting to conclude that they would also reduce cardiovascular events.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
"However a recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of prediabetes interventions (n = 23,152) has demonstrated that while there was a significant reduction in incident diabetes there was no reduction in all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events [33].",Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Although that study included both younger and older patients findings from our study suggest given the lack of an independent association between prediabetes and poor outcomes in older adults such interventions are unlikely to improve outcomes in older adults with prediabetes [26].],Deedwania_2013.txt,0
[Our study has several limitations.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Participants without prediabetes may have developed prediabetes during follow-up thus causing regression dilution and underestimation of the true association [34].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
However the higher incidence of diabetes among those with prediabetes may have cancelled that out.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
In addition our sample size might be relatively small.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
It is possible that some individuals with elevated HbA1c but normal FPG were misclassified as prediabetes [35].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
However CHS only had a single baseline FPG level and did not collect data on HbA1c.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
In one study HbA1c of 6.5% or higher identified  fewer individuals with diabetes than those identified by the ADA criterion of criterion of FPG level ≥ 126 mg/dL [36].,Deedwania_2013.txt,1
We also do not have follow-up data on left ventricular ejection fraction.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
Naturally our findings based on older adults may not be generalized to younger adults.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
However despite suggestions of higher risk of cardiovascular events in younger and middle-age adults with prediabetes [4] interventions do not seem to reduce all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events in these patients [33].,Deedwania_2013.txt,0
In the general population NCEP-MetS predicted all-cause and cardiovascular mortality whereas WHO-MetS predicted only cardiovascular mortality.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Furthermore similar to diabetes in the Framingham Study and other studies there was evidence that gender modified the ability of both NCEP-MetS †In the general population the NCEP-IFG category includes all individuals with a fasting glucose level Ն110 mg/dL as well as individuals taking medications for diabetes.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
‡Limited to those without diabetes or a history of CVD. and WHO-MetS to predict cardiovascular mortality.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
12 Each definition of the MetS was more predictive of cardiovascular mortality in women than in men and although NCEP-MetS was predictive in both women and men WHO-MetS was only significantly predictive in women.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
Although the NCEP criteria for the MetS are viewed as simpler and are more commonly used in the United States the WHO criteria are more widely accepted and used in Europe.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
"4,6 Furthermore although the NCEP-MetS was developed in the context of increasing worldwide rates of obesity and decreasing physical activity as a tool to identify individuals at high cardiovascular risk the WHO-MetS was developed with the underlying cause of the insulin resistance syndrome in mind.",Hunt_2004.txt,1
Why was NCEP-MetS a better predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in our population?,Hunt_2004.txt,0
The prevalences of NCEP-MetS and WHO-MetS were similar in our population.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Each definition of the MetS considered HBP differently; the NCEP-MetS definition had lower thresholds for HBP but gave more weight to HBP and therefore on average identified individuals who had higher  13 Waist circumference a marker of visceral adiposity and an established cardiovascular risk factor was higher in individuals with NCEP-MetS than in individuals with WHO-MetS.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
NCEP-MetS identified individuals with higher levels of triglycerides and in the general population identified individuals with lower HDL cholesterol levels but in the primary prevention population identified older individuals.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Finally the importance in predicting CVD may be partially determined by the population studied and the prevalence of the core components of the MetS in that population.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Hence requiring insulin resistance when glucose levels (both fasting and 2-hour) are normal may weaken the predictive value of the WHO-MetS for CVD in some populations.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
At least two other studies have investigated the association between the MetS as defined by NCEP or WHO and mortality.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
"4,6 The Botnia Study in Sweden and Finland inves-tigated the association between WHO-MetS and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in 4483 men and women 35 to 70 years of age.",Hunt_2004.txt,0
6 Cardiovascular mortality rate was higher in those with WHO-MetS (12.0%) than in those without (2.2%).,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Differences between our WHO-MetS definition (based on 1999 WHO) and the Botnia Study WHO-MetS definition (based on 1998 WHO) include the use of fasting insulin versus the HOMA IR index the inclusion of microalbuminuria in the Botnia Study and the higher systolic blood pressure cut-point in the Botnia Study (160 versus 140 mm Hg).,Hunt_2004.txt,1
Finally the median follow-up in the Botnia Study was 6.9 years considerably shorter than in the current study.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
The Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study in central Finland investigated the association between NCEP-MetS and WHO-MetS and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 1209 men 42 to 60 years of age without CVD diabetes or cancer at baseline.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
4 Although NCEP-MetS and WHO-MetS were consistently associated with coronary heart disease mortality contrary to our results only WHO-MetS was consistently associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Explanations for the discrepant results may include Kaplan-Meier cardiovascular mortality survival estimates for individuals with and without NCEP-MetS and WHO-MetS among individuals without diabetes or cardiovascular disease at baseline (unadjusted). ] [(1) differences in the WHO-MetS definitions (2) oral glucose tolerance tests not completed in the Kuopio Study and (3) differences in prevalence rates of the core metabolic components in the two populations.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Specifically obesity is particularly prevalent in the United States whereas hypertension is particularly prevalent in European populations.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
"14,15",Hunt_2004.txt,0
The modification by gender of the association between the MetS and cardiovascular mortality in the general population has not previously been reported.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
It is important to establish whether similar to diabetes 12 the relative hazard associated with the MetS for cardiovascular mortality rate is greater in women than in men.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
The fact that the association between the MetS and cardiovascular mortality is not modified by gender in the primary prevention population may indicate that frank diabetes is responsible for the modification.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Furthermore when individuals were categorized on the basis of both their NCEP-MetS and diabetes status the gender modification of the association with cardiovascular mortality relative to those without NCEP-MetS or diabetes was statistically significant only in individuals with both NCEP-MetS and diabetes.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
However this is contrary to earlier findings in the SAHS of increased relative cardiovascular risk among prediabetic women in comparison to men.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
16 Furthermore given the low prevalence of the MetS and the few cardiovascular deaths (nϭ50) in the primary prevention population limited statistical power is a second explanation for our inability to detect a gender modification in this population subset.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Third if men with the MetS were more likely to survive a women with the MetS survival bias could explain the modification by gender in the general population.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Finally exclusion of individuals with baseline CVD differentially affected the number of individuals meeting either one or both of the criteria for the MetS; hence of the individuals meeting either criteria the percentage of individuals meeting both criteria was reduced which may have contributed to gender differences between the general and primary prevention populations.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Perhaps the main limitation of our study is the absence of information on microalbuminuria in our study participants.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
However in a recent publication of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study population only between 5.5% and 6.2% of participants without diabetes had evidence of microalbuminuria.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
17 Furthermore in our study because most participants with diabetes already had WHO-MetS (78.2%) and an additional 4.3% of participants even with microalbuminuria would not have been classified as having WHO-MetS only 17.5% of participants with diabetes could have been affected by the inclusion of information on microalbuminuria.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
Hence the effect of inclusion or exclusion of microalbuminuria in defining the MetS in individuals with normoglycemia in individuals with IFG and/or impaired glucose tolerance and in individuals with diabetes appears minimal.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
These results combined with the controversy surrounding microalbuminuria as a component of the MetS suggest that our modified WHO-MetS definition is sufficient.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
18 Given the current obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics it is important to develop clinical screening tools to identify individuals with high cardiovascular risk early in the disease process.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
In our study among individuals without diabetes or CVD at baseline NCEP-MetS identified individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular mortality; hence the MetS indicates a modest increase in cardiovascular risk but not equivalent to the risk associated with diabetes or a history of coronary heart disease.,Hunt_2004.txt,1
Furthermore the simpler NCEP definition tended to be more predictive in lower risk subjects.,Hunt_2004.txt,0
In this Spanish population-based sample regionally representative with up to 18-year followup mortality risk was more than two-times higher (2.02) among adults with known T2D than among adults in the NGT group.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Risk of death associated with T2D was especially increased in younger age groups.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Moreover mortality risk was notably higher in women with T2D than in men (both with known and undiagnosed T2D) because of an increase in cardiovascular mortality.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Although previous studies reported different data comparability is limited because of differences in numbers age and sex structures.,Ares_2019.txt,0
In 2017,Ares_2019.txt,0
Ro ¨ckl et al. [14] published a similar study with 6550 participants (575 with T2D) that showed that mortality was almost twice as high in the T2D group than in the NGT group; however mortality tended to be higher in men than in women in the case of undiagnosed T2D.,Ares_2019.txt,0
"Tancredi et al. [15] followed 435,369",Ares_2019.txt,0
Swedish persons with T2D aged �18 years from 1998-2011 and compared their mortality to matched controls.,Ares_2019.txt,0
The HR for mortality was 1.77 (95% CI 1.03-3.04) in the T2D group.,Ares_2019.txt,0
The KORA S4 study compared a population of 1466 German adults aged 55-74 years and reported higher mortality rates in people with known T2D than for those in the NGT group: 2.6 (95% CI 1.7-3.8) [16].,Ares_2019.txt,0
The ERFORT study (1125 German men aged 40-59 years) compared men with known T2D and normoglycemia.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Mortality risks ranged from 1.86 (95% CI 1.22-2.84) to 2.22 (95% CI 1.36-3.63) depending on the duration of follow-up [17].,Ares_2019.txt,0
Lind et al. [18] used healthcare databases in Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) to calculate annual MRs for adults aged �20 years with and without T2D from 1996-2009.,Ares_2019.txt,0
"HRs for mortality were higher for those with T2D: 2.68 (95% CI  [19,20] the HR for cardiovascular mortality was smaller in undiagnosed diabetes than in diagnosed diabetes (1.54 [95% CI 0.85-2.79] and 2.62 [95% CI 1.81-3.78] respectively).",Ares_2019.txt,0
The results of our analysis of cardiovascular death risk showed a significant association with known T2D but not with newly diagnosed T2D.,Ares_2019.txt,0
This finding could be due to the small sample size and the limited duration of diabetes mellitus.,Ares_2019.txt,0
As stated earlier comparability with other studies is problematic because our sample size was smaller; however HRs for mortality in T2D groups were similar to those obtained in the UK.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Our analyses showed higher HRs for mortality in women with T2D than in men specifically due to cardiovascular disease as reported previously [21][22][23][24].,Ares_2019.txt,0
Furthermore our study showed a similar increase in cancer mortality in both the previously known and unknown T2D groups and this finding was not significantly different from that of the NHANES II study.,Ares_2019.txt,0
"FRESCO [25] a Spanish study of 55,292 individuals showed that diabetes was associated with premature death from cardiovascular disease and cancer in keeping with our results.",Ares_2019.txt,0
According to our data subjects with newly diagnosed T2D have a lower mortality risk than those with known T2D.,Ares_2019.txt,0
This may be due in part to the shorter time of evolution and the improved profile of metabolic and lifestyle risk factors at baseline.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Subjects with undiagnosed T2D had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and better eGFR than those with previously known T2D but higher LDL-cholesterol.,Ares_2019.txt,0
A possible explanation for the last finding is the greater use of lipid-lowering drugs in persons with diagnosed T2D.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Mortality risk in this cohort was studied in 2005 by Valde ´s et al. [9] after 6 years of followup.,Ares_2019.txt,0
According to their results at that time both individuals with diagnosed diabetes and those with undiagnosed diabetes had a risk of mortality around 2.5-3-times greater than individuals with normoglycemia.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Compared with results the increase in mortality in persons with T2D was maintained.,Ares_2019.txt,0
The importance of the time of evolution of diabetes became even more evident in our study as people who were diagnosed in 1998 had lower MRs than those diagnosed before 1998.,Ares_2019.txt,0
In addition according to a previous study [26] prediabetes (IGT or IFG according to IFG-ADA or IFG-WHO criteria) is associated with an increased risk of composite cardiovascular disease (relative risk 1.13 1.26 and 1.30 for IFG-ADA IFG-WHO and IGT respectively) and all-cause mortality (1.13 1.13 and 1.32 respectively).,Ares_2019.txt,1
However another previous study [27] found that prediabetes (those who did not indicate diagnosed diabetes and had HbA1C 5.7%-<6.5% [39-<48 mmol/mol]) was not associated with increased mortality and raised HbA1c did not appear to have a statistically significant impact upon cancer mortality.,Ares_2019.txt,1
Our data showed similar results; the prediabetes group did not have an increased MR compared to the NGT group using ADA 2018 criteria.,Ares_2019.txt,0
This absence of association may be because we sent letters to all individuals with their results encouraging them to incorporate lifestyle changes if they had any alterations in glucose metabolism.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Several limitations apply to this study.,Ares_2019.txt,0
The main limitation is the small sample size with a limited number of events available for analysis.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Thus it was difficult to demonstrate statistical differences.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Nevertheless for cases in which we able to show statistical significance the effect can be considered large.,Ares_2019.txt,0
However this study has several strengths including that it was population-based and the mortality follow-up was relatively long.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Moreover cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors were included to calculate the multivariate adjustment of the regression models.,Ares_2019.txt,0
Our analysis based on a large European population with more than 155 000 person years of follow-up addresses the sex difference in the risk of death related to hyperglycaemia.,Hu_2003.txt,0

The age-adjusted relative hazard of ischaemic heart disease death in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic people is also greater in Rancho Bernardo women than in men [14].,Hu_2003.txt,0

The degree of this association is greater in women than in men [15].,Hu_2003.txt,0

"""The reason why diabetes has a greater relative risk for death from all causes especially from CVD in women than in men is not clear.",Hu_2003.txt,0
When any other coronary heart disease risk factors exist diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death [28].,Hu_2003.txt,1
Therefore in our study we wanted to evaluate if the association between asymptomatic newly-diagnosed diabetes and mortality would also be the same in men as in women with other CVD risk factors.,Hu_2003.txt,0
In people who smoked had hypertension exhibited hypercholesterolaemia or were overweight the relative risk from CVD mortality was 1.3 to 2.1 times higher in diabetic women than in diabetic men compared with normoglycaemic women and men respectively.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Hyperglycaemia could have a stronger additive or synergistic effect on smoking hypertension hypercholesterolaemia and overweight in women than in men.,Hu_2003.txt,0
In this study adjustment for other measured confounding factors was done thus the findings are likely to be real.,Hu_2003.txt,0
"One study has also indicated that the increased CVD risk of diabetic women could be mediated in part by womens usually favourable lipoprotein profile lost in the presence of diabetes [28].""",Hu_2003.txt,0
In this study absolute levels of mortality i.e. agestandardised death rates from all causes and CVD are higher in men than in women in any glucose category.,Hu_2003.txt,0
The multivariate-adjusted risk from all-cause and CVD mortality was also greater in men than in women in each of three glucose categories.,Hu_2003.txt,0
The largest absolute sex differential for CVD mortality is for people with normal glucose followed by those with IGR and the smallest in people with newly-diagnosed asymptomatic diabetes.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Thus men are at a higher risk of death from risk factors other than hyperglycaemia.,Hu_2003.txt,0
The difference in CVD risk factors between men and women is the likely explanation for the sex differential in CVD risk.,Hu_2003.txt,0
The higher risk of death associated with either hyperglycaemia itself or the combined effect of hyperglycaemia with other risk factors in diabetic women compared with diabetic men might result in a decrease in the sex difference in mortality among diabetic patients.,Hu_2003.txt,0
The impact of gender and general risk factors on the occurrence of atherosclerotic vascular disease in Type 2 diabetes has been recently reviewed [16].,Hu_2003.txt,0
It indicates that the overall relative risk (the ratio of men to women) for coronary heart disease mortality in diabetes is 1.46 (1.21-1.95) and in nondiabetes 2.29 (2.05-2.55) and also suggests that the gender differential is reduced in diabetes which is consistent with our results.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Since hyperglycaemia could have a stronger additive or synergistic effect on smoking hypertension hypercholesterolaemia and overweight in women than in men this study suggests more aggressive intervention in subjects with hyperglycaemia especially women.,Hu_2003.txt,0

This study is a large collaborative study from 14 centres in Europe.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Although this study has a number of strengths several limitations also need to be considered.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Firstly CVD incidence data are not available however people with prevalent CVD might be included in this analysis.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Secondly no follow-up data about people with newly-diagnosed diabetes under regular health care are collected.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Thirdly the accuracy of CVD classification of the death certificates is not perfect and could vary among the populations included in this study.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Nevertheless the same principles of death certification were applied to both sexes and across the other risk factor strata.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Thus such misclassifications in the individual centres make little difference for the analyses applied in this kind of study.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Also all deaths in all centres were coded using the same code of International Classification of Diseases.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Finally several other risk factors such as serum low-density lipoprotein high-density lipoprotein triglyceride concentrations HgbA 1c  C-reactive protein microalbuminuria waist to hip ratio number of cigarettes physical inactivity fibrinogen homocysteine acute and chronic infections haemostatic factors psychosocial factors dietary factors and genetic effects are not available for our analysis.,Hu_2003.txt,0
These could affect the sex-specific mortality or they could act as mediating factors.,Hu_2003.txt,0
In conclusion in both non-diabetic and diabetic populations men have higher absolute risks of death from all causes and CVD than women.,Hu_2003.txt,0
The difference is larger in non-diabetic subjects than in people with IGR or newly-diagnosed asymptomatic diabetics.,Hu_2003.txt,0
The relative risk of death associated with newly-diagnosed diabetes is greater in women than in men and thus the absolute sex difference in the risk of death is reduced in the diabetic population.,Hu_2003.txt,0
This is important to keep in mind when studying CVD risk factors in the population and when planning a strategy to prevent CVD especially in the female population.,Hu_2003.txt,0
Numerous cardiovascular risk factors have been identified during the past 50 years of modern epidemiologic research and the role of glycemia is just now being defined.,Smith_2002.txt,0

"Another meta-analysis of 53 prospective cohort studies (n 5 1,611,339 participants) reported prediabetes to be associated with a modestly increased risk for composite CVD outcomes which included angina percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary revascularization and peripheral artery disease in to CHD stroke and heart failure when prediabetes was defined by impaired fasting glucose (relative risk 1.13 [95% CI 1.06 1.20]) and when prediabetes was defined by impaired glucose tolerance (1.32 [1.23 1.40]).",Hubbard_2019.txt,1
Participants with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance also had a higher risk for CHD stroke and all-cause mortality in this meta-analysis.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
In the same meta-analysis prediabetes defined as HbA 1c between 5.7 and 6.4% (39 and 46 mmol/mol) was associated with an increased risk for composite CVD outcomes and CHD but not for stroke or all-cause mortality (6).,Hubbard_2019.txt,1

"The authors concluded that the apparent association between prediabetes and CVD may be attributable to the existence of concomitant hypertension (9,10).",Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Results from the current analysis are consistent with the prior studies in China showing an increased risk for CVD events and all-cause mortality associated with hypertension.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
In the current analysis no association was present between prediabetes and CVD or all-cause mortality among participants with and without hypertension separately and there was no evidence of interaction between prediabetes and hypertension.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Although there was no evidence of an association between prediabetes and an increased risk for CVD in the current study prediabetes was associated with an increased risk for diabetes among participants with and without hypertension.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Additionally a higher proportion of participants with both prediabetes and hypertension versus those with prediabetes alone developed diabetes.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
This is consistent with prior studies.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
For example in an In the U.S. black adults have a higher prevalence of prediabetes compared with other racial/ethnic groups (3).,Hubbard_2019.txt,0

Because of this increased risk black adults with prediabetes may benefit from lifestyle modification including a heart-healthy diet and increased physical activity which could reduce their risk for developing diabetes and CVD (31).,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
"Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for CVD (32,33).",Hubbard_2019.txt,1
In the current study hypertension was associated with an increased risk for CVD and all-cause mortality regardless of prediabetes status.,Hubbard_2019.txt,1
There are many evidence-based approaches for preventing hypertension including losing weight among those who are overweight or obese following a hearthealthy diet increasing physical activity and reducing sodium intake (24).,Hubbard_2019.txt,0

The generalizability of the current results to other geographic regions and to people of other racial/ethnic groups is not known.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
"Furthermore,several covariates including physical activity and cigarette smoking were determined using self-report.",Hubbard_2019.txt,0
There may be some misclassification in defining prediabetes and incident diabetes because of the use of only a single measurement of HbA 1c or serum glucose lack of glucose tolerance testing and reliance on self-reported diabetes status and glucose-lowering medication use.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
In conclusion there was no evidence in the current study of an association between prediabetes and an increased risk for CVD events or all-cause mortality regardless of hypertension status among black adults.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
In contrast hypertension alone or concomitant with prediabetes was associated with an increased risk for CVD events and all-cause mortality.,Hubbard_2019.txt,1
These findings suggest that black adults with hypertension may benefit from lifestyle and/or pharmacological interventions to lower their risk for CVD and all-cause mortality.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
Among black adults with prediabetes interventions should be implemented to prevent the development of diabetes which is a risk factor for CVD.,Hubbard_2019.txt,0
"In this large prospective 18-year mortality follow-up of 47,951 individuals we found that newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus and known diabetes mellitus but not impaired glucose regulation were associated with fatal coronary artery disease in both women and men.",Madssen_2012.txt,0
In gender comparisons the higher CAD mortality observed among men compared with women became gradually and consistently weaker as the abnormal glucose regulation became more advanced and this attenuation was evident already in people with impaired glucose regulation.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
This supports the hypothesis that any hyperglycemia also below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus may attenuate the usual protective effect of the female gender in CAD mortality and should therefore be prevented.,Madssen_2012.txt,0
In conclusion this study sheds light on gender-differences in the clinical outcomes of prediabetes.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Our results from a region with a high burden of cardiometabolic risk factors indicate that IFG-ADA can identify high-risk men for CKD and high-risk women for hypertension.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0
Moreover the risk of stroke in men with IFG-WHO and CHD in women with IGT is nearly as high as undiagnosed diabetes.,Parizadeh_2019.txt,0

In the present large prospective Whitehall II cohort study of adults aged 50-80 years with simultaneous measures of different glycemic measures we found that the prevalence of prediabetes defined by FPG and/or HbA 1c was three times higher when the ADA criteria were used than when the WHO/IEC definitions were used.,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
Individuals with prediabetes defined by HbA 1c had substantially higher risk of CVD and mortality than those defined by the FPG or 2hPG criteria irrespective of whether the cut point of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) was used.,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
For none of the glycemic measures did we find an inflection point for risk of CVD and mortality over the prediabetes range.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Furthermore the excess risk of CVD and death associated with having prediabetes was greatly reduced in HbA 1cdefined prediabetes and null in FPG-and 2hPG-defined prediabetes after adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
These findings indicate that there is no obvious optimal glycemic cutoff for risk stratification and the higher risk for CVD and death among individuals with prediabetes is mainly explained by its clustering with other risk factors Data are means (SD) or percentage (95% CI).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"WHO/IEC: normal glycemia FPG ,6.1 mmol/L and HbA 1c ,6.0% and for prediabetes by FPG only FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/L and HbA 1c ,6.0%; HbA 1c only HbA 1c ,6.0-6.4% and FPG ,6.1 mmol/L; and both FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/L and HbA 1c 6.0-6.4%.",Vistisen_2018.txt,1

This challenges the use of the prediabetes classification as a stand-alone tool for risk stratification among older adults.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"Only a few previous studies have compared different definitions of prediabetes in relation to CVD and mortality in the same population (15,22).",Vistisen_2018.txt,1
Warren et al. (15) found in the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study that HbA 1c was more specific and provided better risk discriminating regarding future major events compared with FPG or 2hPG concentrations.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced but still significantly elevated in those with HbA 1cdefined prediabetes.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
However incidence rates for cardiovascular mortality became all prediabetes subgroups after adjustment for  cardiovascular risk factors (15) which is in accordance with the findings from our analysis and underscores focusing on nonglycemic risk factors in individuals with prediabetes.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
In contrast to the ARIC study we also reported absolute 10-year risk estimates over the prediabetes range of all the three glycemic measures and these showed a higher absolute risk for HbA 1c than for FPG and 2hPG concentrations.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
We found no inflection point of risk in the association which is in line with the findings from the population-based Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study (13).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
We further evaluated the risk associated with different combinations of HbA 1c and FPG levels which enabled us to show that prediabetes HbA 1c levels are associated with elevated risk of CVD and death even when FPG levels are normal while the opposite is not the case (i.e. prediabetes FPG and normal HbA 1c levels).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"In support of this finding data from the ADDITION study (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care) showed that among individuals with normal glucose tolerance on an OGTT those with HbA 1c levels in the range 6.0-6.4% had 21% higher risk of all-cause mortality than those with HbA 1c levels ,6.0% (23) again suggesting that HbA 1c predicts mortality beyond fasting and 2-h glucose levels.",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
In relation to the use of FPG for diagnosis of prediabetes results from meta-analyses have shown that prediabetes defined by the WHO IFG criterion but not the ADA IFG criterion is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (24).,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
Similar results were found in relation to the risk of stroke (25).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
A recent meta-analysis however concluded that IFG defined by the ADA criterion is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality cardiovascular mortality coronary heart disease and stroke (14).,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
However a subgroup analysis revealed that among individuals aged 55 years or older ADA-defined IFG was not associated with all-cause mortality (14).,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
Combined with our results these findings suggest that the increased CVD and mortality risk associated with prediabetes FPG levels may decrease with age.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
It is thus likely that FPG is better for risk stratification in younger adults whereas HbA 1c is a better and more stable measure for health status in older adults but this hypothesis needs to be tested in study populations with a wide age range.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"Part of the stronger association found between HbA 1c and incident CVD may be explained by the capacity of HbA 1c to reflect average glycemia but HbA 1c may also indirectly capture information about other important pathophysiological processes such as iron metabolism and lowgrade inflammation (26,27).",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
However their causal effects need to be examined in more detail.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
A major strength of the Whitehall II cohort is that the measures of FPG 2hPG and HbA 1c were obtained simultaneously and can be linked to validated measures of morbidity and mortality over a long follow-up period (20).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Deaths attributable to causes other than CVD were included in the analysis to avoid bias from competing risk.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
However two out of three of the composite events were related to CVD and sensitivity analyses with only CVD as outcome were consistent with our conclusions.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Another strength of the current analysis is the application of all the different definitions for prediabetes.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"Most previous studies have only focused on a single definition of prediabetes (either WHO/IEC or ADA) and thereby used different reference groups for defining normoglycemia (13,23,28).",Vistisen_2018.txt,1
Accordingly event rates cannot be compared directly across studies to derive solid evidence on the association of prediabetes with morbidity and mortality.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"This could also explain why previous meta-analyses on the relationship of prediabetes with future morbidity and mortality have shown conflicting results (12,13,24,25).",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
In the Whitehall II study some individuals with prediabetes may develop diabetes during follow-up and subsequently receive treatment to reduce CVD risk.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
This could potentially have biased the results in the sense that the calculated event rates for WHO/IEC-defined prediabetes are underestimated relative to the rates in ADAdefined prediabetes which have lower levels of glycemia and therefore are less likely to convert to diabetes during followup.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
It is also possible that the way diabetes has been diagnosed by general practitioners between the study visits during follow-up may have introduced bias.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Before 2012 diabetes was mostly diagnosed by measurement of FPG levels but after 2012 there has been a shift from FPG to HbA 1c for diagnosis of diabetes in clinical practice in the U.K. (9).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
However given that end of follow-up in our study was 30 June 2015 we expect these effects to even out.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Therefore it is reasonable to believe that the differential associations of FPG versus HbA 1c with CVD and mortality are not caused by diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and CVD risk in individuals identified by one specific diagnostic criterion over another during follow-up.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
During the last decades there has been an increased focus on identifying high-risk individuals in order to prevent future disease and premature mortality.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
As a result the diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for many diseases (29) which has increased sensitivity at the cost of specificity.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"With the adoption of HbA 1c diagnostic criterion for diabetes (9,30) the possibility of also using HbA 1c to risk stratify individuals for diabetes prevention is obvious but the challenge is to choose the optimal cut point.",Vistisen_2018.txt,1
"As shown in this and other studies (13,28) there does not seem to be an inflection point in the nondiabetes range for HbA 1c in the association with CVD or mortality.",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"Accordingly when deciding on the diagnostic test and thresholds used to guide preventive interventions one needs to consider the effectiveness of interventions as well as the health and economic consequences of false positives and false negatives (5,31).",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
The major diabetes prevention trials performed thus far have included individuals with IGT and not people identified as having high risk by FPG or HbA 1c (32)(33)(34).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Despite the limited evidence for prevention in these groups of individuals the current recommendations from ADA suggest that all individuals with prediabetes (IFG IGT or HbA 1c 5.7-6.4%) should be targeted for diabetes preventive efforts (lifestyle modification or metformin) (35).,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
Because of the poor concordance between the different diagnostic criteria it is questionable whether results from trials in IGT will apply to individuals identified by slightly elevated FPG or HbA 1c levels.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Thus intervention studies among individuals identified by FPG or HbA 1c aiming at reducing risk for diabetes and CVD are warranted in order to improve and modify the current recommendations (36).,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"More recent research also suggests that intermediate time points or different glucose curve patterns during an OGTT may be relevant to use for risk stratification purposes (37,38).",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
In addition it will be important to evaluate prediabetes in the context of overall CVD risk because relationship of glycemia with other cardiovascular risk factors.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
Thus future risk prediction models should study whether easily measured risk factors and/or cheap predict future diabetes CVD and mortality.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
In conclusion our study showed that individuals with prediabetes defined using the ADA criteria have a lower risk of CVD and all-cause mortality than individuals with prediabetes identified by the WHO/IEC criteria.,Vistisen_2018.txt,1
This difference was mainly driven by the lower incidence of CVD or death among individuals with IFG but normal levels of HbA 1c .,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
"Our results showed a high incidence rate of CVD and death in those with HbA 1c levels 5.7-5.9% which advocates for lowering the cut point for prediabetes to ,6.0% for CVD preventive interventions.",Vistisen_2018.txt,0
That said our study also shows that a substantial part of the excess risk in prediabetes is explained by other CVD risk factors suggesting that the use of prediabetes as an independent factor for risk stratification is questionable.,Vistisen_2018.txt,0
The findings in this study support our original hypothesis that IGT predicts all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older Chinese men high risk for CVD.,Fang_2019.txt,0
In addition our results indicate that IGT entails increased risk of progression to T2DM and increased risk of composite cardiovascular outcomes in,Fang_2019.txt,1
This study-utilising data from a nationally representative sample-demonstrates an association between HbA1 C and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality among those with and without diagnosed diabetes that remains after adjustment for a range of confounding factors including adiposity.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
If these result were to be replicated within further studies the lowering of HbA1 C within populations could become an important public health goal.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Our findings suggest that higher FPG levels in people without a previous diagnosis of DM were associated with a higher risk of fatal nonfatal and total stroke.,Sui_2011.txt,0
An FPG test is easy and inexpensive to perform and has good reproducibility and small variability in clinical practice.,Sui_2011.txt,0
An early diagnosis of IFG as well as frank DM may lead to interventions such as weight control diet modification and medication treatment that optimize glycemic con-trol and reduce stroke risk in asymptomatic patients with hyperglycemia.,Sui_2011.txt,0
Clinicians should also carefully assess stroke risk in patients with FPG levels between 100 and 109 mg/dL.,Sui_2011.txt,0
With the release of the American Diabetes Association and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines significant controversy exists about the optimal BP target among patients with DM or prediabetes worldwide.,Tian_2018.txt,0
Our study investigated the CVD risks caused by a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg in a Chinese population-based cohort and found for the first time in our knowledge that a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg results in a significantly higher CVD risk in Chinese adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk $10% or DM but not in those with normoglycemia or prediabetes.,Tian_2018.txt,1
Evidence in support of a lower threshold (130/80 mmHg) has been reported in recent studies including the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive medications.,Tian_2018.txt,1
"In SPRINT (4) targeting an SBP of ,120 mmHg (automated BP corresponding to 130 mmHg in office) versus ,140 mmHg resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death among 9,361 patients without DM.",Tian_2018.txt,0
"Subsequently a systematic review and meta-analysis provided strong support for lowering SBP to ,130 mmHg which led to decreased risks of CVD (20,21).",Tian_2018.txt,0
However these studies were not stratified according to baseline 10-year ASCVD risk.,Tian_2018.txt,0
"A metaanalysis of data in 67,475 patients across 11 trials and 26 randomized groups showed that treating 1,000 patients for 5 years would prevent 14 (95% CI 8-21) 20  24  and 38 (16-61) cardiovascular events (P = 0.04 for trend) in those with a baseline 5-year ASCVD risk of ,11% 11-15% 15-21% and .21% respectively (22).",Tian_2018.txt,0
The current study investigated the CVD events with BP 130-139/80-89 mmHg in the general population stratified for 10-year ASCVD risk.,Tian_2018.txt,1
We confirmed that a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg does not result in a significantly increased risk of CVD in general but it does in those with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk $10% (HR 3.82 [95% CI 1.42-9.78]; P = 0.005) (Supplementary Table 2) which supports the use of predictive baseline ASCVD equations to inform BPlowering treatment decisions.,Tian_2018.txt,1
The prevalence of hypertension among adults with DM is ;80% and the coexistence of hypertension and DM markedly increases the risk of developing CVD and microvascular disease (23).,Tian_2018.txt,1
The presence of type 2 DM almost triples the risk of developing CVD at any level of SBP starting from prehypertensive levels (24).,Tian_2018.txt,1
Accumulated evidence suggests that BP reduction in patients with type 2 DM and hypertension largely improves CVD outcomes (25).,Tian_2018.txt,0
However the optimal BP target in individuals with DM remains controversial.,Tian_2018.txt,0
Moreover little or insufficient evidence exists on the outcome benefit of the threshold for the initiation of antihypertensive therapy in patients with prediabetes.,Tian_2018.txt,0
To judge the usefulness and appropriateness of the new threshold we must look at its influence on the long-term incidence of the CVD (7).,Tian_2018.txt,0
The current study a population-based prospective cohort lasting 10.9 years enabled us to explore the incidence of CVD among individuals with a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg and DM or prediabetes.,Tian_2018.txt,0
After assessing the association between BP categories and risk of CVD we continued to analyze the risk for CVD by blood glucose categories and BP categories combined.,Tian_2018.txt,0
As expected we found that the coexistence of BP $140/90 mmHg or treated and DM was associated with the most significant increases in the incidence of CVD (HR 4.98 [95% CI 1.88-13.17]).,Tian_2018.txt,1
A BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg combined with DM increased the CVD risk 3.54 times (95% CI 1.05-11.88).,Tian_2018.txt,1
Of note a BP of 130-139/ 80-89 mmHg combined with prediabetes was not associated with an elevated CVD risk in the crude and adjusted models.,Tian_2018.txt,1
To our knowledge we provide the first data on the occurrence of CVD among Chinese adults with a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg and DM or prediabetes.,Tian_2018.txt,0
The appropriate BP target in patients with DM is a long-time controversial issue.,Tian_2018.txt,0
"On the basis of the UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) 36 (25) and clinical trials from UKPDS 38 (26) Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial (27) Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial (28) and Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study (29) previous hypertension and DM guidelines suggested a BP target ,130/80 mmHg in patients with DM (30,31).",Tian_2018.txt,1
"After the publication of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)-BP study (3) targeting SBP to ,120 mmHg versus ,140 mmHg did not reduce the rate of fatal and nonfatal CVD events in patients with DM; therefore more guidelines returned to a recommended BP ,140/90 mmHg in patients with hypertension and DM.",Tian_2018.txt,0
However the ACCORD-BP results were questioned in the literature because of statistical power.,Tian_2018.txt,0
The secondary analysis of the ACCORD trial demonstrated a significant outcome benefit in the intensive BP/ standard glycemic group (32).,Tian_2018.txt,0
"Recently a pooled analysis from the ACCORD-BP and SPRINT studies showed that intensive BP lowering (SBP target ,120 mmHg) may have a similar favorable effect and appears to decrease cardiovascular events in patients with and without type 2 DM (33).",Tian_2018.txt,0
"In addition a meta-analysis of 13 randomized clinical trials in 37,736 participants suggested that in patients with type 2 DM or prediabetes an SBP treatment goal of 130-135 mmHg is acceptable (34).",Tian_2018.txt,1
Very few published studies focused on the optimal BP level in individuals with prediabetes.,Tian_2018.txt,0
Our previous study showed that prediabetes combined with BP $140/90 mmHg increases the risk for CVD (14).,Tian_2018.txt,1
"A post hoc analysis of SPRINT showed that the beneficial effects of intensive SBP treatment (target ,120 mmHg) on CVD events and all-cause mortality are similar among individuals with prediabetes (defined as fasting serum glucose $5.6 mmol/L) and normoglycemia; however only fasting blood glucose was used to define the prediabetes status whereas 2-h blood glucose was not included in the diagnoses (35).",Tian_2018.txt,1
In the current study where glycemic status was defined by FPG and 2hPG we found that a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg may result in a significantly increased CVD risk in DM rather than in normoglycemia or prediabetes.,Tian_2018.txt,1
This study had several limitations.,Tian_2018.txt,0
First because serum creatinine and urinary albumin levels were not measured at baseline related information of chronic kidney disease could not be evaluated among participants with a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg.,Tian_2018.txt,0
Nonetheless we assayed these levels in the 10.9-year follow-up to investigate chronic kidney disease factors in this population in the future 16-year follow-up.,Tian_2018.txt,0
Second we did not perform a baseline HbA 1c test in every participant in 2002 and therefore might have missed some participants with DM detected by HbA 1c alone.,Tian_2018.txt,0
However the clinical diagnosis of both prediabetes and DM were based on FPG and 2hPG and HbA 1c was not included in the diagnostic criteria until 2010 (18).,Tian_2018.txt,1
In conclusion this study confirms that patients with a BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg combined with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk $10% or DM may have an increased risk for CVD.,Tian_2018.txt,1
A BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg does not lead to a significantly elevated CVD risk among those with normoglycemia or prediabetes.,Tian_2018.txt,1
"DM and an increased baseline 10-year ASCVD risk may result in increased CVD events in the future which implies that the targeted BP should be ,130-139/80-89 mmHg in these patients.",Tian_2018.txt,1
The current change in the 2017 guidelines was mainly based on epidemiological evidence not randomized controlled trials; thus there is little or insufficient evidence on the outcome benefit of antihypertensive therapy from adequately powered placebocontrolled clinical trials even in the SBP range of 130-139 mmHg.,Tian_2018.txt,0

This large population-based prospective study found that elevated FPG 2h-PG and HbA 1c are significant predictive indicators of incident diabetes and its complications.,Lu_2019.txt,0
2h-PG remained significantly associated with the risk of diabetes CVD and cancer and with all-cause mortality in models including FPG and HbA 1c .,Lu_2019.txt,0
Furthermore 2h-PG significantly improved the prediction of diabetes CVD and all-cause mortality over conventional risk factors.,Lu_2019.txt,0
These findings have important clinical implications.,Lu_2019.txt,0
FPG 2h-PG and HbA 1c have all been shown to be related to the risk of diabetes in epidemiological studies (21)(22)(23)(24).,Lu_2019.txt,0
Our study however contributes new knowledge about the relative importance of individual measures and their combinations in predicting the risk of incident diabetes.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Specifically these findings indicate that 2h-PG or combinations of 2h-PG with other glycemic measures better predict risk than FPG HbA 1c  or their combination.,Lu_2019.txt,0
The combination of three glycemic measures best predicts risk of diabetes.,Lu_2019.txt,0
"Our study observed nonlinear associations of glycemic measures with CVD and all-cause mortality which is consistent with findings from other observational studies (24,25).",Lu_2019.txt,0
"In the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) which included data from 73 prospective studies involving 294,998 participants nonlinear associations with CVD were reported for fasting glucose postload glucose and HbA 1c (25).",Lu_2019.txt,0
"Prediabetes defined on the basis of fasting glucose postload glucose and HbA 1c was associated with higher risk of CVD and allcause mortality in prospective studies (5,6).",Lu_2019.txt,1

"It has been reported that compared to FPG the glucose tolerance test is more sensitive in identifying individuals who are at high risk for prediabetes and diabetes among Asian populations (2,26).",Lu_2019.txt,0
Intriguingly we also observed differences in the associations of the different glycemic measures across age and BMI strata.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Further investigations are warranted in order to validate our findings and explore the detailed relationship and potential mechanisms.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Postload hyperglycemia differs from fasting hyperglycemia with regard to pathophysiology and the risk of diabetes-related clinical outcomes and it mainly results from moderate to severe insulin resistance and from an impaired late-phase insulin secretory response to oral glucose.,Lu_2019.txt,1
Our findings indicated that 2h-PG remained independently associated with risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in models with FPG and HbA 1c  and it improved risk prediction more than did FBG or HbA 1c .,Lu_2019.txt,0
"When using the same cutoffs the ARIC study and ERFC reported that HbA 1c better predicts risk for CVD (9,24,25).",Lu_2019.txt,0
In those studies however not all three glycemic measures were obtained at the same visit.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Methodological and study population differences notwithstanding the reasons why our results do not agree with the ARIC study and ERFC findings are unclear.,Lu_2019.txt,0
"By contrast several prospective studiesd including the Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) Study the Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE) Study and the Framingham Offspring Studydreported that 2h-PG better predicted risk for CVD and mortality than did FPG or HbA 1c (8,27,28).",Lu_2019.txt,0
Elevated blood glucose has been associated with an increased risk of cancer in several prospective studies (29)(30)(31).,Lu_2019.txt,1
In ;1.3 million men and women in Korea elevated fasting serum glucose levels and a diagnosis of diabetes were independent risk factors for cancer overall and for several prevalent cancers (29).,Lu_2019.txt,1
"In a pooled analysis of 274,126 men and 275,818 women from six European cohorts fasting glucose was associated with an increased risk of cancer overall and at several sites (30).",Lu_2019.txt,0
"In 29,629 Japanese adults aged 46-80 years elevated HbA 1c was associated with overall cancer risk (31).",Lu_2019.txt,0
In our study 2h-PG but not FPG or HbA 1c  was associated with overall cancer.,Lu_2019.txt,0
"""The primary strengths of this study are its population-based design its large sample size and its ability to compare the risks of FPG 2h-PG and HbA 1c as they relate to CVD cancer and all-cause mortality simultaneously.",Lu_2019.txt,0
Although comparisons of the strength of the relationships between the glycemic variables and outcome must take into account their collinearity the given analysis suggests that postload glucose may be a stronger predictor than the other two variables.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Our study does have a number of important limitations.,Lu_2019.txt,0
First the study participants were only followed for a mean of 3.8 years.,Lu_2019.txt,0
This relatively short follow-up duration reduced the number of clinical events and the studys statistical power especially for determining cancer incidence and all-cause mortality.,Lu_2019.txt,0
"However we have counted 1,624 incident cancer cases and 2,409 total deaths.",Lu_2019.txt,0
Second the study participants only had one follow-up visit and glycemic measures were obtained at only two time points (the baseline and follow-up visits).,Lu_2019.txt,0
This could limit the accuracy of the timing of diagnoses especially diabetes.,Lu_2019.txt,0
The methods by which we collected data regarding clinical outcomes may also limit the sensitivity of ascertaining 12.2% of study participants were lost to follow-up.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Rural-to-urban migration and urban redevelopment in China have contributed to this loss.,Lu_2019.txt,0
In the diabetes analysis 13.1% participants did not have an OGTT and an HbA 1c test at follow-up and thus were excluded from the final analysis for incident diabetes.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Fourth anemia and hemoglobin might affect HbA 1c measurement but that was not measured in this study.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Nevertheless this study was conducted among the general population.,Lu_2019.txt,0
In a sensitivity analysis further adjustment for self-reported anemia did not change the study findings.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Single measurements of FPG 2h-PG and HbA 1c are subject to within-person variability.,Lu_2019.txt,0
High variability in any of the measures could lead to imprecise associations and regression dilution bias of associations between glycemic measures and study outcomes (32).,Lu_2019.txt,0
Fifth microvascular complications which are more specific complications of diabetes than cardiovascular events cancer or allcause mortality were not included as an outcome.,Lu_2019.txt,0
Finally the interpretations and conclusions of this study and others in the literature are fundamentally dependent on the approach used to model the three glycemic markers.,Lu_2019.txt,0
In this study we used cutoffs established by 2010 ADA criteria for prediabetes and diabetes based on FPG 2h-PG and HbA 1c to compare their associations with the outcomes.,Lu_2019.txt,1
"Although the risk estimates did not change significantly for CVD cancer and all-cause mortality based on the higher cutoffs of 6.1 mmol/L for impaired fasting glucose and 6.0% for elevated HbA 1c  additional caution should be taken to balance the appropriate sensitivity and specificity of a glycemic marker.""",Lu_2019.txt,0
In conclusion our findings suggest that 2h-PG remains independently predictive of the outcomes in models including FPG and HbA 1c .,Lu_2019.txt,0
Therefore in addition to FPG and HbA 1c measurements 2h-PG should be considered for routine testing in order to better assess the risks of diabetes CVD cancer and all-cause mortality.,Lu_2019.txt,0
To conclude we showed similar prevalence of silent CAD among normoglycemic pre-diabetic and NDM females; however only nondiabetic women had significant increased risk of CVD/CHD in the presence of silent CAD.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Additionally NDM males with silent CAD showed significant risk for CVD/CHD and mortality events.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
Thus different strategies might be appropriate regarding the presence of silent CAD in males and females with different categories of glucose regulation.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
It seems that screening ECG for prevention of CVD events might be considered mainly among non-diabetic female and NDM male populations.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0
However more studies should be performed to confirm the screening strategy.,Hadaegh_2015.txt,0

All-cause mortality is also increased in subjects with very low levels of fasting glucose 2 h glucose and HbAlc.,Kowall_2011.txt,0
The results from this study suggest that postchallenge hy-perglycemia might be independently associated with mortality in the general U.S. population.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
The effect is strongest in the presence of elevated fasting glucose but present when fasting plasma glucose is normal.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
This effect is only partially mediated by established CVD risk factors such as concurrent abnormal blood pressure and lipids.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
Adjusting for fasting the magnitude of the estimated RH of mortality associated with the continuous increase of 2-h glucose did not change; however the 95% CI included the null value.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
A high correlation between fasting and 2-h glucose levels (r 2 ϭ 0.90) was observed in our study population.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
Strengths of this study include its national representation and a length of follow-up ranging from 12 to 16 years.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
Nevertheless several limitations should be kept in mind.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
First there was nonresponse in NHANES II at each stage of the survey and a potential misclassification of vital status.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
In particular for adults age 20 -74 years only 68.0% of participants selected for the survey in the OGTT subsample completed the examination (26).,Saydah_2001.txt,0
"However respondents and nonrespondents did not differ significantly in demographic or health-related characteristics (27,33).",Saydah_2001.txt,0
Second a person not found to be deceased as of 31 December 1992 was assumed to be alive at the end of follow-up (31).,Saydah_2001.txt,0
"However because vital status was determined independent of glucose tolerance status if misclassification had occurred it was likely to be nondifferential therefore producing a conservative bias (34,35).",Saydah_2001.txt,0
Third similar to other previous studies the results of this study are based on baseline glucose tolerance.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
It is likely that participants with high fasting and 2-h plasma glucose levels progressed to diabetes during follow-up which is known to increase the risk of both all-cause and CVD mortality.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
Since 1980 there have been a number of studies investigating the relationship of postchallenge hyperglycemia and mortality (3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20).,Saydah_2001.txt,0
"In general these studies have found an increased risk of death with increasing postchallenge glu-   (5,(12)(13)(14).",Saydah_2001.txt,0
"Other studies that have found similar results have been limited by relatively short follow-up (Ͻ10 years) and were not representative of the general U.S. population (3,4,6 -11,15-18).",Saydah_2001.txt,0
In other studies IGT was found to be a significant predictor of mortality but IFG was not (16).,Saydah_2001.txt,0
The results of this study support previous study findings from the Diabetes Epidemiology Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE) study (4) that WHO criteria categories yield risk estimates that are slightly stronger than those of ADA criteria.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
This further suggests that OGTTs enable the identification of postchallenge hyperglycemic individuals who may have the greatest risk of death.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
The identification of individuals with PCH is important.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
First such individuals might be offered aggressive interventions aimed at improvement of hyperglycemia and modification of other risk factors such as hypertension obesity and hyperlipidemia.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
Second these individuals could be identified for nonpharmacological treatments such as weight reduction and increasing physical activity.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
Third one might devise pharmacological interventions aimed specifically at the modification of PCH.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
In conclusion these results suggest that PCH has predictive value for all-cause mortality and may also predict CVD mortality independently of other CVD risk factors.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
In addition however because of co-linearity a larger study would be required to demonstrate independence from fasting glucose on epidemiological grounds alone.,Saydah_2001.txt,0
"""Inclusion of the fasting glucose 5.6-6.1 mmol/L category raised the IFG prevalence nearly fourfold and modestly elevated the risk of progression to diabetes.",Onat_2013.txt,1

This is in contrast to the reported association of prediabetes with higher risk of these outcomes in younger and middle-aged adults and is likely explained in part by the fact that older adults with new-onset diabetes might die from other competing risk factors for mortality before developing diabetes-related cardiovascular or other complications.,Deedwania_2013.txt,0

A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted representing a large sample of the general Iranian population aged 35 years and older from the Isfahan Province and determined using a random multistage cluster-sampling 10-year cohort.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
The five end points considered as study outcome were unstable angina (UA) acute occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) sudden cardiac death (SCD) brain stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD).,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Of the 6323 subjects scheduled for assessment of diabetes state 617 were diabetics and 712 were pre-diabetic.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
In addition of these subjects 1754 had hypertension and 2500 had pre-hypertension.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Analysing only pre-hypertension pre-diabetes and its combination and adjusted for gender and age variables pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes status together could only effectively predict occurrence of MI (hazard ratio (HR)=3.21 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-9.76 P=0.04).,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
In the same COX regression models pre-hypertension status could predict UA and CVD occurrence (HR=2.94 95% CI: 1.68-5.14 P<0.001 and HR=1.74 95% CI: 1.23-2.47 P=0.002 respectively).,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
However pre-diabetes status could not predict any of these events after adjustment for gender and age.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Our data provide valuable evidence of the triggering role of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together on appearance and progression of MI even in healthy individuals and the significant predicting value of pre-hypertension on the occurrence of UA and CVD.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
In this regard the value of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together and the pre-hypertension state alone are clearly superior to pre-diabetes state alone in predicting cardiovascular events.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0

To create a simple prediction rule that could perform as well as the 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose (PCPG) test to predict those at risk for diabetes.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
We created a prediction rule in one sample and prospectively validated it for incident diabetes in a separate cohort.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Research design and methods: A cross-sectional analysis with data from the Rancho Bernardo Study (age 67 +/- 11 years) to derive a rule predicting abnormal PCPG >/=140 mg/dl using demographic clinical and laboratory data of nondiabetic participants with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <126 mg/dl.,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
Data from the Health Aging and Body Composition study (age 74 +/- 3 years) were used to prospectively validate this rule for incident diabetes and compare it with the predictive ability of the PCPG test.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
"Results: Of 1,549 RBS participants 514 (33%) had PCPG >/=140 mg/dl.",Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Female sex age triglycerides and FPG were most significantly associated with abnormal PCPG.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Based on standardized beta-coefficients we allotted 1 point for female sex triglycerides >/=150 mg/dl or FPG 95-104 mg/dl.,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
Age >/=70 years or FPG 105-115 mg/dl were given 2 points and FPG 116-125 mg/dl received 3 points.,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
In the validation cohort this simple prediction rule was as good as the 2-h PCPG test for predicting incident diabetes (C-statistic: 0.71 for both).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Conclusions: Advanced age female sex FPG and triglycerides were able to predict adults at risk for diabetes equally well as the 2-h PCPG test.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0

Of the patients studied 593 suffered stroke or TIA over a total risk analysis time of 100 982 years.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Higher baseline morning glucose (100 to 126 mg/dL vs under 100 mg/dL) was associated with 31% more diagnoses (2.4% vs 1.8% P < .001).,Nielson 2007.txt,1
Incidence rate was 5.3 per 1000 patient-years for those patients with glucose over 100 mg/dL and 3.9 per 1000 patient-years for those with glucose under 100 mg/dL (P <.001).,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated baseline glucose was associated with a progressive increased risk with time.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
A Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for age body mass index sex creatinine lipids smoking and medications showed that elevated fasting glucose was associated with an increased hazard for a new event (hazard ratio 1.24 95% CI 1.05-1.46 glucose over 100 mg/dL vs under 100 mg/dL).,Nielson 2007.txt,1
Thus patients with higher baseline blood glucose levels in the absence of diabetes and after adjustment for covariants have a significantly greater risk for development of cerebrovascular disease.,Nielson 2007.txt,0

BACKGROUND: There are few published data on the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke in American Indians.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
The aims of this observational study were to determine the incidence of stroke and to elucidate stroke risk factors among American Indians.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
METHODS AND RESULTS: This report is based on 4549 participants aged 45 to 74 years at enrollment in the Strong Heart Study the largest longitudinal population-based study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in a diverse group of American Indians.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
At baseline examination in 1989 to 1992 42 participants (age- and sex-adjusted prevalence proportion 1132/100 000 adjusted to the age and sex distribution of the US adult population in 1990) had prevalent stroke.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
Through December 2004 306 (6.8%) of 4507 participants without prior stroke suffered a first stroke at a mean age of 66.5 years.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
The age and sex-adjusted incidence was 679/100 000 person-years.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
Nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction occurred in 86% of participants with incident strokes; 14% had hemorrhagic stroke.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
The overall age-adjusted 30-day case-fatality rate from first stroke was 18% with a 1-year case-fatality rate of 32%.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
"Age diastolic blood pressure fasting glucose hemoglobin A(1c,) smoking albuminuria hypertension prehypertension and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for incident stroke.",Zhang 2008.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with US white and black populations American Indians have a higher incidence of stroke.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
The case-fatality rate for first stroke is also higher in American Indians than in the US white or black population in the same age range.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
Our findings suggest that blood pressure and glucose control and smoking avoidance may be important avenues for stroke prevention in this population.,Zhang 2008.txt,0
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that cardiovascular disease occurs to the greatest extent in persons with prediabetes mellitus who are also insulin resistant.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
In 2003 664 non-diabetic women (n = 457) and men (n = 207) aged 52 ± 16 and 53 ± 15 years were surveyed during a programme for cardiovascular disease prevention.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Fasting plasma glucose concentrations defined participants as having normal fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose <5.6 mmol/L) or prediabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose ⩾ 5.6 and <7.0 mmol/L).,Salazar 2016.txt,1
The tertile of prediabetes mellitus subjects with the highest fasting plasma insulin concentration was classified as insulin resistant.,Salazar 2016.txt,1
Baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors were accentuated in prediabetes mellitus versus normal fasting glucose particularly in prediabetes mellitus/insulin resistant.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
In 2012 86% of the sample were surveyed again and the crude incidence for cardiovascular disease was higher in subjects with prediabetes mellitus versus normal fasting glucose (13.7 vs 6.0/100 persons/10 years; age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio = 1.88 p = 0.052).,Salazar 2016.txt,0
In prediabetes mellitus the crude incidences were 22.9 versus 9.6/100 persons/10 years in insulin resistant versus non-insulin resistant persons (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio = 2.36 p = 0.040).,Salazar 2016.txt,0
In conclusion cardiovascular disease risk was accentuated in prediabetes mellitus/insulin resistant individuals with a relative risk approximately twice as high compared to prediabetes mellitus/non-insulin resistant subjects.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that newly diagnosed glucose intolerance is common among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).,Tamita 2012.txt,0
The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term clinical cardiovascular outcomes in participants with AMI with abnormal fasting glucose compared with normal fasting glucose and an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared with a normal OGTT.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Methods: A prospective study was performed in 275 consecutive patients with AMI 85 of whom had pre-diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM).,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Those without DM were divided into two groups based on the 75 g OGTT at the time of discharge.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) was defined as 2 h glucose ≥140 mg/dl; 78 patients had normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 112 had AGT.,Tamita 2012.txt,1
The same patients were also reclassified into the normal fasting glucose group (NFG; n=168) or the impaired fasting glucose group (IFG; n=22).,Tamita 2012.txt,1
The association between the glucometabolic status and long-term major adverse cardiovascular event rates was evaluated.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the AGT group had a worse prognosis than the NGT group and an equivalent prognosis to the DM group (p<0.0005).,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that the HR of AGT to NGT for major adverse cardiovascular event rates was 2.65 (95% CI 1.37 to 5.15 p=0.004) while the HR of DM to NGT was 3.27 (1.68 to 6.38 p=0.0005).,Tamita 2012.txt,0
However Cox HR of IFG to NFG for major adverse cardiovascular event rates was 1.83 (0.86 to 3.87) which was not significant.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Conclusion:,Tamita 2012.txt,0
In patients with AMI an abnormal OGTT is a better risk factor for future adverse cardiovascular events than impaired fasting blood glucose.,Tamita 2012.txt,1

Background: Although diabetes is a well-known risk factor for death its impact on cancer death is not clearly understood.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Furthermore it remains controversial whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are associated with increased risk of mortality.,Kim 2014.txt,1
We investigated the impact of diabetes or glucose tolerance categories on all cause and cause-specific mortality.,Kim 2014.txt,0
"Methods: Mortality analysis was conducted in three population-based cohort studies of 3,801 participants divided according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (normal; stage 1 IFG [5.6≤FPG<6.1 mmol/L]; stage 2 IFG [6.1≤FPG<7.0 mmol/L]; diabetes mellitus [DM]-FPG); or 2-hour glucose after 75 g glucose loading (2hPG) (normal; IGT; DM-2hPG) or a combination of FPG and 2hPG criteria.",Kim 2014.txt,1
Results: During a median follow-up of 11.0 years 474 subjects died from all causes.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Hazard ratios (HRs) for all cause death were higher in those with diabetes as defined by either FPG or 2hPG criteria than their normal counterparts (HR 2.2 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6 to 2.9 for DM-FPG; HR 2.0 95% CI 1.5 to 2.7 for DM-2hPG).,Kim 2014.txt,1
Similarly diabetes defined by either FPG or 2hPG was associated with cancer death (HR 2.9 95% CI 1.7 to 5.0; and HR 2.1 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9 respectively).,Kim 2014.txt,1
Although neither IFG nor IGT conferred higher risk for death when combining stage 2 IFG and/or IGT the risk of all cause death was higher than in subjects with normal glucose regulation (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.6).,Kim 2014.txt,1
Conclusion: Diabetes is associated with higher risk of death from all causes and cancer.,Kim 2014.txt,1
In subjects without diabetes stage 2 IFG and/or IGT confers increased risk for mortality.,Kim 2014.txt,1
Background: Chronic hyperglycemia plays a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD); however the cut-off level beyond which glycemia becomes detrimental is still controversial.,Nigam 2007.txt,1
Postprandial glycemia may be a stronger CAD risk factor than fasting glycemia in patients without documented heart disease.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Objectives:,Nigam 2007.txt,0
To identify the contributions of fasting and postprandial glycemia to cardiovascular risk in patients with documented coronary artery disease.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
"Methods: The Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry is a database of 24,958 patients with suspected or proven CAD who underwent cardiac catheterization between 1974 and 1979.",Nigam 2007.txt,0
Median long-term follow up was 14.7 years (interquartile range 9.8 to 16.2 years).,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to fasting glucose levels and 2 h postprandial (postmeal) plasma glucose (2hPG) levels.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
"A total of 13,176 patients with baseline fasting glucose levels and 1691 patients with 2hPG levels were identified.",Nigam 2007.txt,0
Results: Impaired fasting glycemia was associated with a 1.2-fold increase in both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.40 for cardiovascular mortality) while undiagnosed diabetes was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for the same end points.,Nigam 2007.txt,1
Postprandial hyperglycemia (2hPG of 7.8 mmol/L to 11.0 mmol/L following an average meal) was not associated with a significant risk of death after adjustment for traditional risk factors or in the presence of fasting glucose of less than 6.1 mmol/L.,Nigam 2007.txt,1

Retrospective cohort study of 768 patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus post-MI at one centre in Yorkshire between November 2005 and October 2008.,George 2015.txt,0
Patients were categorised as normal glucose tolerance (NGT n = 337) IGT (n = 279) and NDM (n = 152) on pre- discharge oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,George 2015.txt,1
Primary end-point was the first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiovascular death non-fatal MI severe heart failure (HF) or non-haemorrhagic stroke.,George 2015.txt,1
Secondary end-points were all cause mortality and individual components of MACE.,George 2015.txt,0
Results: Prevalence of NGT impaired fasting glucose (IFG) IGT and NDM changed from 90% 6% 0% and 4% on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to 43% 1% 36% and 20% respectively after OGTT.,George 2015.txt,0
102 deaths from all causes (79 as first events of which 46 were cardiovascular) 95 non fatal MI 18 HF and 9 non haemorrhagic strokes occurred during 47.2 ± 9.4 months follow up.,George 2015.txt,0
Event free survival was lower in IGT and NDM groups.,George 2015.txt,0
IGT (HR 1.54 95% CI: 1.06-2.24 p = 0.024) and NDM (HR 2.15 95% CI: 1.42-3.24 p = 0.003) independently predicted MACE free survival.,George 2015.txt,0
IGT and NDM also independently predicted incidence of MACE.,George 2015.txt,0
NDM but not IGT increased the risk of secondary end-points.,George 2015.txt,0

The associations between IFG incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) events remains unclear.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
METHODS: The MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study included participants who were 45 to 84 years or age and free of clinical CV disease at baseline (2000 to 2002).,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Type 2 DM was defined as fasting glucose >125 mg/dl or receiving antidiabetes medication at baseline and follow-up examinations; IFG was defined as no T2DM and fasting glucose 100 to 125 mg/dl.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the association between IFG and incident DM and also between IFG and incident CV events.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
"RESULTS: Of 6,753 participants included in these analyses 840 (12.7%) had T2DM and 940 (13.8%) had IFG at the baseline examination.",Yeboah 2011.txt,0
During 7.5 years of follow-up there were 418 adjudicated CV events.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Type 2 DM was associated with an increased CV incidence in the univariate model (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.83 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.25 to 3.56 p < 0.0001) and multivariate model adjusted for demographics and traditional risk factors (HR: 1.87 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.37 p < 0.0001) compared with subjects not having T2DM (IFG plus normal fasting glucose).,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Impaired fasting glucose was associated with increased incidence of T2DM (HR: 13.2 95% CI: 10.8 to 16.2 p < 0.001) that remained after adjusting for demographics highest educational level physical activity and body mass index (HR: 10.5 95% CI: 8.4 to 13.1 p < 0.001) compared with normal fasting glucose.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Impaired fasting glucose was associated with incident CV events in the univariate model (HR: 1.64 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.14 p < 0.001) but not in the full multivariate model (HR: 1.16 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.52 p = 0.3) compared with normal fasting glucose.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Having IFG was not independently associated with an increased short-term risk for incident CV events.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1

Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their glucometabolic status as defined by the American Diabetes Association: normal glucose metabolism (NGM) pre-DM and diabetes mellitus (DM).,Farhan 2019.txt,1
These groups were compared with regard to coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (defined as cardiac death or arrest myocardial infarction or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Results: Among 547 patients 162 (29.6%) had NGM 202 (36.9%) had pre-DM and 183 (33.4%) had DM.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to intravascular ultrasound findings indicative of vulnerable plaques.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Patients with DM had a higher crude rate of MACEs than those with pre-DM or NGM (25.9% vs. 16.3% and 16.1%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.02 respectively).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
In an adjusted Cox regression model using NGM as the reference group DM (hazard ratio: 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 3.86; p = 0.006) but not pre-DM (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 2.33; p = 0.41) was associated with increased risk for MACEs.,Farhan 2019.txt,1
Conclusions: Impaired glucose metabolism is common among patients presenting with ACS.,Farhan 2019.txt,0

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was defined as fasting glucose between 5.6 and 7 mmol L(-1) and a level >or=7 mmol L(-1) as newly detected diabetes.,Janszky 2009.txt,1
Patients with a fasting glucose level <5.6 mmol L(-1) and without a history of diabetes were classified as normoglycemic (NG).,Janszky 2009.txt,1
An estimate of insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Results:,Janszky 2009.txt,0
We recorded 219 deaths 121 deaths from cardiac causes during the follow-up period.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
After adjustment for several potential confounders hazard ratios for total mortality were 1.36 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.99 P=0.11) 2.27 (1.26-4.09 P=0.006) and 2.15 (1.43-3.21 P<0.001) for patients with IFG newly detected diabetes and history of diabetes when compared to the NG group.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Cardiac mortality risk of hospitalization for recurrent nonfatal AMI stroke or heart failure generally showed a similar pattern to that of total mortality.,Janszky 2009.txt,0

The current study evaluates the prognosis of nondiabetic patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) over a 7.7-year follow-up period.,Fisman 2001.txt,0
"Methods: A total of 11,853 patients with documented coronary artery disease aged between 45 and 74 years were examined.",Fisman 2001.txt,0
Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of their fasting blood glucose levels at screening: nondiabetic individuals patients with IFG and undiagnosed diabetic patients.,Fisman 2001.txt,0
Patients who were on any type of pharmacologic antidiabetic treatment were excluded from the study.,Fisman 2001.txt,0
Mortality rates were assessed separately for each group.,Fisman 2001.txt,0
Results:,Fisman 2001.txt,0
The population comprised 9773 nondiabetic patients (82.4% glucose up to 109 mg/dL) 1258 patients with IFG levels (10.6% glucose 110-125 mg/dL) and 822 diabetic subjects (7% glucose > or =126 mg/dL).,Fisman 2001.txt,0
Patients were followed up from 6.2 to 9.0 years (mean follow-up period 7.7 +/- 1.5 years).,Fisman 2001.txt,0
Crude mortality was lower in the nondiabetic subjects than in the 2 other groups.,Fisman 2001.txt,0
All-cause mortality in the nondiabetic group was 14.3% compared to 20.1% in patients with IFG and 24.3% in the undiagnosed (P <.001).,Fisman 2001.txt,0
Multivariate adjustment showed the lowest mortality in nondiabetic subjects who exhibited a survival rate of 0.86 at the end of the follow-up whereas the lowest survival-0.75-was seen among undiagnosed diabetic patients (P =.0001).,Fisman 2001.txt,0
An intermediate value of 0.78 was documented for patients with IFG (P <.01).,Fisman 2001.txt,0
After multivariate analysis with nondiabetic patients as the reference group IFG was identified as a consistent predictor of increased all-cause and IHD mortality with hazard ratios of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.21-1.59) and 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.64) respectively.,Fisman 2001.txt,1
Conclusions:,Fisman 2001.txt,0
The main finding of this study is the substantially increased mortality rate among nondiabetic coronary patients with IFG who had fasting glucose levels markedly lower than hitherto acknowledged as defining overt diabetes.,Fisman 2001.txt,0
Background:,Chen 2018.txt,0
The impact of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) on survival outcomes in patients with acute heart failure (HF) is unclear and the relationship between intensity of glycemic control of FPG in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and HF prognosis remains uncertain.,Chen 2018.txt,0
This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of FPG in patients with acute HF.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Methods: A total of 624 patients hospitalized with acute HF from October 2000 to April 2014 were enrolled in this study.,Chen 2018.txt,0
All patients were stratified by three groups according to their admission FPG levels (i.e. DM impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and non‐DM).,Chen 2018.txt,0
All‐cause and cardiovascular mortality was the primary end point and HF re‐hospitalization was the secondary end point during follow‐up period.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Results: A total of 587 patients were included in final analysis.,Chen 2018.txt,0
The all‐cause mortality rates of patients with DM IFG and non‐DM were 55.5% 40.3% and 39.2% with significant difference (P = 0.001).,Chen 2018.txt,0
Moreover compared with those with IFG (34.3%) and non‐DM (32.6%) patients with DM had significantly higher rate of cardiovascular mortality (45.1%).,Chen 2018.txt,0
Multiple,Chen 2018.txt,0
Cox regression analysis showed that DM as well as IFG was related to all‐cause mortality (DM: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.936 P < 0.001; IFG: HR = 1.672 P = 0.019) and cardiovascular mortality (DM: HR = 1.739 P < 0.001; IFG: HR = 1.817 P = 0.013).,Chen 2018.txt,1
However they were both unrelated to HF re‐hospitalization.,Chen 2018.txt,0
DM patients with strictly controlled blood glucose (FPG <3.9 mmol/L) had higher all‐cause mortality than patients with non‐DM IFG and DM patients with moderately controlled glucose (3.9 mmol/L≤ FPG <7.0 mmol/L).,Chen 2018.txt,1
Likewise both the primary end point and secondary end point were found to be worse in DM patients with poorly controlled blood glucose (FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L).,Chen 2018.txt,1
Conclusions: IFG and DM were associated with higher all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with acute HF.,Chen 2018.txt,1
The association between mortality and admission FPG in DM patients with acute HF appeared U‐shaped.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Background: Long-term clinical outcome is less well known in up to presentation persons unknown with diabetes mellitus who present with acute myocardial infarction and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels on admission.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
We aimed to study the prognostic impact of deranged HbA1c at presentation on long-term mortality in patients not known with diabetes presenting with acute myocardial infarction.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Methods: A single-centre large prospective observational study in patients with and without known diabetes admitted to our hospital for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus was defined as HbA1c of 48 mmol/l or greater and pre-diabetes mellitus was defined as HbA1c between 39 and 47 mmol/l.,Hermanides 2019.txt,1
The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at short (30 days) and long-term (median 52 months) follow-up.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Results:,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Out of 7900 acute myocardial infarction patients studied 1314 patients (17%) were known diabetes patients.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Of the 6586 patients without known diabetes 3977 (60%) had no diabetes 2259 (34%) had pre-diabetes and 350 (5%) had newly diagnosed diabetes based on HbA1c on admission.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Both short-term (3.9% vs. 7.4% vs. 6.0% p<0.001) and long-term mortality (19% vs. 26% vs. 35% p<0.001) for both pre-diabetes patients as well as newly diagnosed diabetes patients was poor and comparable to known diabetes patients.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
After multivariate analysis newly diagnosed diabetes was independently associated with long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.72 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.34 P=0.001).,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Conclusions:,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
In the largest study to date newly diagnosed or pre-diabetes was present in 33% of acute myocardial infarction patients and was associated with poor long-term clinical outcome.,Hermanides 2019.txt,1
Newly diagnosed diabetes (HbA1c ⩾48 mmol/mol) is an independent predictor of long-term mortality.,Hermanides 2019.txt,1
More attention to early detection of diabetic status and initiation of blood glucose-lowering treatment is necessary.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Background:,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
We assessed the prevalence of newly diagnosed prediabetes and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and their impact on long-term mortality in patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Methods:,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
We included patients hospitalized with HFrEF and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Baseline two-hour oral glucose tolerance test was used to classify patients as normoglycaemic or having newly diagnosed prediabetes or T2DM.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
Outcomes included post-discharge all-cause and cardiovascular mortality during the median follow-up of 2.1 years.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Results:,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
At baseline out of 150 patients (mean-age 57 ± 12 years; 88% male) prediabetes was diagnosed in 65 (43%) patients and T2DM in 29 (19%) patients.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
These patients were older and more often with NYHA class III symptoms but distribution of comorbidities was similar to normoglycaemic patients.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Taking normoglycaemic patients as a reference adjusted risk of all-cause mortality was significantly increased both in patients with prediabetes (hazard ratio 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-6.3; p = 0.040) and in patients with T2DM (hazard ratio 5.3; 95% CI 1.7-15.3; p = 0.023).,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Likewise both prediabetes (hazard ratio 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-7.9; p = 0.041) and T2DM (hazard ratio 9.7; 95% CI 2.9-36.7; p = 0.018) independently increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with normoglycaemic individuals.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
There was no interaction between either prediabetes or T2DM and heart failure aetiology or gender on study outcomes (all interaction p-values > 0.05).,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Conclusions:,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Newly diagnosed prediabetes and T2DM are highly prevalent in patients hospitalized for worsening HFrEF and NYHA functional class II-III.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
Importantly they impose independently increased long-term risk of higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Background:,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0

Design: A prospective population-based study.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Methods: Data from the first visit of 19 381 participants were used.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Participants were divided into groups according to their glycaemic and heart failure level and comparisons were made between the groups and disease-free participants serving as a reference group.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
The risk of mortality and morbidity was calculated with adjustments for main cardiovascular risk factors and ischaemic heart disease.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Results:,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Participants in the reference group were younger had lower body mass indices and more seldom a history of myocardial infarction compared with diseased groups.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Mortality was lowest in the reference group (P<0.0001) increasing to a maximum in participants with the combination of glucose abnormality and heart failure.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Prognostically the mortality risk associated with abnormal glucose regulation was increased but was lower than the risk of diabetes.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
The risk of a new myocardial infarction was highest in participants with diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.0] or diabetes in combination with heart failure (HR 1.8; CI 1.1-2.7).,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Conclusions:,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Heart failure or glucose abnormalities are related to increased morbidity and mortality.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,1
The combination of glucose abnormality and heart failure did however not add further to the unfavourable prognosis in the presence of ischaemic heart disease.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,1
Objective: Glycated hemoglobin was recently recommended for use as a diagnostic test for diabetes.,Selvin 2011.txt,0
We examined the association between 2010 American Diabetes Association diagnostic cut points for glycated hemoglobin and microvascular outcomes (chronic kidney disease end-stage renal disease [ESRD] and retinopathy) and formally tested for the presence of risk thresholds in the relationships of glycated hemoglobin with these outcomes.,Selvin 2011.txt,1

Results:,Selvin 2011.txt,0
During a median of 14 years of follow-up of individuals without diagnosed diabetes at baseline clinical categories of glycated hemoglobin were associated with risk of chronic kidney disease with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.12 (0.94-1.34) and 1.39 (1.04-1.85) for glycated hemoglobin 5.7-6.4% and ≥6.5% respectively as compared with <5.7% (P trend = 0.002).,Selvin 2011.txt,1
The corresponding HRs for ESRD were 1.51 (0.82-2.76) and 1.98 (0.83-4.73) respectively (P trend = 0.047).,Selvin 2011.txt,0
In the absence of diagnosed diabetes glycated hemoglobin was cross sectionally associated with the presence of moderate/severe retinopathy with adjusted odds ratios of 1.42 (0.69-2.92) and 2.91 (1.19-7.11) for glycated hemoglobin 5.7-<6.5% and ≥6.5% respectively compared with <5.7% (P trend = 0.011).,Selvin 2011.txt,1
Risk associations were stronger among individuals with a history of diabetes.,Selvin 2011.txt,0
We did not observe significant thresholds in the associations of glycated hemoglobin with kidney disease risk or retinopathy.,Selvin 2011.txt,0

Methods:,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
Healthy individuals without diabetes (n=596 55-75 years) were examined for silent myocardial infarction (≥ 1 mm ST-interval during ≥,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
1 min) by ambulant 48-h continuous electrocardiogram monitoring and impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l).,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
Results: After 6.3 years 77 subjects met the endpoint of myocardial infarction and/or death.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
The prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia at inclusion was 12.3% in subjects with impaired fasting glucose and 11.7% in subjects with normal fasting glucose P=0.69.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
Subjects with impaired fasting glucose/silent myocardial ischaemia more often met the endpoint (36%) than subjects with impaired fasting glucose/no silent myocardial ischaemia (15%) subjects with normal fasting glucose/silent myocardial ischaemia (12%) and subjects with normal fasting glucose/no silent myocardial ischaemia (10%) respectively (P<0.001).,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
In a Cox model including these four study groups of interest gender age smoking habits blood pressure and total cholesterol only subjects with impaired fasting glucose/silent myocardial ischaemia exhibited an increased risk of death or myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 2.5 P=0.016).,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
Conclusion:,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
The combination of impaired fasting glucose and silent myocardial ischaemia was associated with the poorest prognosis in middle-aged and older subjects without previously known glucose metabolic aberration and heart disease.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
OBJECTIVE:,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
We compared the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in subgroups of prediabetes defined by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 2 h plasma glucose (2hPG) or HbA1c.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1

"A total of 628 (11.6%) had prediabetes by the World Health Organization (WHO)/International Expert Committee (IEC) criteria (FPG 6.1 6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 6.0-6.4%) and 1,996 (36.8%) by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%).",Vistisen 2018.txt,1
"In a subset of 4,730 individuals with additional measures of 2hPG 663 (14.0%) had prediabetes by 2hPG.",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Incidence rates of a major event (nonfatal/fatal CVD or all cause mortality) were compared for different definitions of prediabetes with adjustment for relevant confounders.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
RESULTS: Compared with that for normoglycemia incidence rate in the context of prediabetes was 54% higher with the WHO/IEC definition and 37% higher with the ADA definition (P < 0.001) but declining to 17% and 12% after confounder adjustment (P >= 0.111).,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
Prediabetes by HbA1c was associated with a doubling in incidence rate for both the IEC and ADA criteria.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
However upon adjustment excess risk was reduced to 13% and 17% (P >= 0.055) respectively.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Prediabetes by FPG or 2hPG was not associated with an excess risk in the adjusted analysis.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes defined by HbA1c was associated with a worse prognosis than prediabetes defined by FPG or 2hPG.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
However the excess risk among individuals with prediabetes is mainly explained by the clustering of other cardiometabolic risk factors associated with hyperglycemia.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Objective: Associations of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels to incident coronary and cardiovascular events among non-diabetic patients with coronary artery disease are unclear.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
We investigated relations of HbA1c to long-term prognosis in such patients.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
Methods: A prospective cohort of 2519 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography for suspected stable angina pectoris (SAP) was divided into pre-defined categories according to HbA1c (%) levels (<5.0 5.0-5.6 (reference) 5.7-6.4) and followed for median 4.9 years.,Rebnord 2015.txt,1
The primary end-point was major coronary events (including non-fatal and fatal acute myocardial infarctions and sudden cardiac death).,Rebnord 2015.txt,1

Baseline glycated hemoglobin was predictive of all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) for glycated hemoglobin values of <5.0 5.0-5.4 5.5-5.9 6.0-6.4 6.5-7.4 and ≥7.5% for all-cause mortality were 1.36 (0.85-2.18) 1.00 (0.76-1.32) 1.00 (reference) 1.11 (0.88-1.41) 1.39 (1.07-1.82) and 2.15 (1.32-3.53) respectively.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,1
Similar J-shaped relationships were found between glycated hemoglobin and cardiovascular and cancer mortality.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
The associations of glycated hemoglobin with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality remained significant after inclusion of fasting glucose as a covariate.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
However fasting glucose was not significantly related to mortality when adjusting for glycated hemoglobin.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Conclusions: Glycated hemoglobin significantly and independently of fasting glucose predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in whites at intermediate to high cardiovascular risk.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease.,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
Few prospective studies however have examined metabolic syndrome as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an Asian population.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
"We studied the occurrence of CKD in 6,371 subjects without CKD or diabetes mellitus at baseline 1997 through 2002 in Okinawa Japan.",Tozawa 2007.txt,0
CKD was defined as dipstick-positive proteinuria (>or=1+) or a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2).,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the modified criteria of the Adult Treatment Panel III in which body mass index (>or=25 kg/m2) was substituted for the waist circumference measurement.,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
Logistic analysis was used to analyze the effect of metabolic syndrome on the development of CKD.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
During the 5-year follow-up 369 (5.7%) participants developed CKD.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
After adjusting for age sex current cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking habits at baseline the relative risk of developing CKD was 1.86 (95% confidence interval: 1.43-2.41 p<0.0001) in subjects with metabolic syndrome.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Compared with those without metabolic syndrome risk components the adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) was 1.49 (1.10-2.01) 1.89 (1.38-2.59) and 2.65 (1.19-3.68) in those with 1 2 or >or=3 metabolic syndrome risk components respectively.,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
Metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD in the Japanese population.,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
Detection and treatment of metabolic syndrome should be stressed as a strategy to prevent CKD.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Background and aims:,Donahue 2011.txt,0
There is little epidemiological evidence regarding the association of impaired glucose metabolism with recurrent cardiovascular events.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We therefore examined potential sex differences in the effect of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) on recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a community-based study of survivors of a first acute myocardial infarction (MI).,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Methods and results:,Donahue 2011.txt,0
This report focuses on 1226 incident MI cases (28.4% women) discharged alive from area hospitals in the Western New York Acute MI Study (1996-2004).,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Deaths and underlying cause of death were determined via query of the National Death Index (Plus) Retrieval Program with follow-up through December 31 2004.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Outcomes reported included fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or coronary revascularization surgery and total stroke.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Traditional CHD risk factors and other explanatory variables were determined by clinical examination after the first acute event.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125mg/dl.,Donahue 2011.txt,1
During a mean follow-up of 4.5 years there were 91 recurrent events (26.1%) in women and 173 recurrent events (19.7%) in men.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
After multivariable adjustment the hazard ratios for recurrent cardiovascular events were 1.96 (95% CI: 1.15-3.16) and 2.59 (1.56-4.30) in women with IFG and with diabetes respectively compared to normoglycemic women.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Among men neither IFG nor diabetes was independently related to risk of recurrence.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Conclusions:,Donahue 2011.txt,0
In this study IFG was a strong risk factor for recurrent cardiovascular events only among women.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
These results suggest that increased cardiovascular risk in MI survivors begins at lower glucose levels in women than men.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
AIMS:,Shi 2016.txt,0
To examine the association between impaired fasting glucose (IFG)/type 2 diabetes and mortality as well as to explore any interactions with dietary intake patterns in a Chinese population.,Shi 2016.txt,0
METHODS:,Shi 2016.txt,0
We followed 2849 Chinese adults aged 20 years and older for 10 years.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Fasting plasma glucose was measured at baseline in 2002.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Dietary patterns were constructed using factor analysis.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated by Cox proportional hazards analysis (all-cause mortality) and competing risks regression [cardiovascular disease (CVD)].,Shi 2016.txt,0
RESULTS: Of the 2849 participants 102 had diabetes and 178 had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at baseline.,Shi 2016.txt,0
"We documented 184 deaths (70 CVD deaths) during 27,914 person-years of follow-up.",Shi 2016.txt,0
Diabetes was associated with death from all causes (HR 2.69 95 % CI 1.62-4.49) after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.,Shi 2016.txt,1
Diabetes had a HR of 1.97 (95 % CI 0.84-4.60) for CVD death.,Shi 2016.txt,0
IFG had 83 % increased risk of all-cause mortality.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Among those with low and high intake of a vegetable-rich dietary pattern the HR of IFG/diabetes for all-cause mortality was 3.25 (95 %CI 1.95 5.44) and 1.38 (95 % CI 0.75-2.55) (p for interaction 0.019) respectively.,Shi 2016.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and IFG are associated with a substantial increased risk of death in Chinese adults.,Shi 2016.txt,1
Dietary patterns associated with a high intake of vegetable were associated with a decrease in the risk of mortality for those with IFG/diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Whether prediabetes mellitus (Pre-DM) alone or combined with hypertension is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease has not been fully clarified.,Liu 2018.txt,1
This study aimed to further confirm whether the relation of Pre-DM to cardiovascular disease differs between individuals with or without hypertension.,Liu 2018.txt,0
A total of 7121 consecutive patients with angina-like chest pain who received coronary angiography were evaluated and 4193 patients with angiography-proven stable new-onset coronary artery disease were enrolled into the study.,Liu 2018.txt,0
They were divided into 3 groups according to diabetes mellitus status and further stratified by hypertension.,Liu 2018.txt,0
The severity of coronary artery disease was assessed by number of diseased vessels and Gensini score.,Liu 2018.txt,1
All subjects were regularly followed up for the occurrence of the composite end points.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Comparisons of coronary artery disease severity and outcomes were performed among these groups.,Liu 2018.txt,0
During an average of 11 338 patient-years of follow-up 434 (10.35%) cardiovascular events occurred.,Liu 2018.txt,0
No significant difference was observed in coronary severity and composite end point events between Pre-DM and normal glucose regulation groups (both P>0.05).,Liu 2018.txt,0
However when hypertension was also incorporated as a stratifying factor cardiovascular disease risk assessed by coronary severity and clinical prognosis was significantly elevated in Pre-DM plus hypertension and diabetes mellitus plus hypertension groups compared with the reference group with normal glucose regulation and normal blood pressure (all P<0.05).,Liu 2018.txt,1
The present study indicated that among patients with stable new-onset coronary artery disease the increased cardiovascular risk with Pre-DM is largely driven by the coexistence of hypertension rather than Pre-DM per se.,Liu 2018.txt,0
OBJECTIVE: Diabetes and prediabetes subjects have increased risk for mortality.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
We analyzed the mortality risk due to all causes cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer in Korean subjects participating in a health-screening program according to baseline glycemic status and HbA1c levels.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
"MATERIALS/METHODS: Among 241,499 participants of a health-screening program between 2005 and 2012 the risk of death from all causes CVD and cancer was calculated based on the baseline glycemic status (normoglycemia prediabetes and diabetes) and HbA1c levels.",Rhee 2016.txt,0
Uncontrolled diabetes was defined as HbA1c>=7.0%.,Rhee 2016.txt,1
Vital status and confirmation of the cause of death were based on the analysis of death certificate records from the National Death Index.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
"RESULTS: During 923,343.1 person-years of follow-up 877 participants died.",Rhee 2016.txt,0
The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of subjects with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes to normoglycemic subjects for all-cause mortality were 1.58 (95% CI 1.24-2.03) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.78-2.86) respectively.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
The HRs of subjects with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes to normoglycemic subjects for mortality due to cancer were 1.75 (95% CI 1.23-2.48) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.13-2.45).,Rhee 2016.txt,0
However glycemic status was not significantly associated with the risk of mortality due to CVD.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
The subjects with HbA1c higher than 6.5% showed more than 2-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality and the subjects with HbA1c lower than 5.2% showed increased HR (1.45 95% CI 1.06-1.97) compared with those with HbA1c of 5.5% in subjects not taking anti-diabetic medications.,Rhee 2016.txt,1
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risk from all causes and cancer significantly increased in diabetes subjects regardless of the glucose control status.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
In subjects not taking anti-diabetic medications both high and low HbA1c resulted in increased risk for all-cause mortality.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factor research has recently broadened its focus based on new data indicating the benefits of low risk i.e. favorable levels of all major risk factors.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
The aims of this study were to assess further the relation of low risk to coronary heart disease risk and implications for prevention.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
DESIGN:,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
We conducted a prospective population-based Italian study of 7438 men and 13 009 women aged 35-69 years with a mean follow-up of 10.4 years and validated first coronary events.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
METHODS: Baseline coronary heart disease risk was classified into three categories: low risk; unfavorable but not high risk; and high risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,1
To analyze the relation of these risk profiles to coronary heart disease incidence age-adjusted sex-averaged coronary heart disease incidence was calculated for persons free of coronary heart disease and stroke stratified as baseline low risk unfavorable but not high risk or high risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
To assess the independent relationship of individual risk factors to coronary heart disease incidence multivariate proportional hazards models were computed for combinations of risk factors.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
RESULTS: Only 2.7% of participants met low risk criteria; 81.4% were high risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Age-adjusted coronary heart disease incidence for the whole cohort was 37.1 out of 10000 person-years (men 59.0; women 15.3).,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
No coronary heart disease events occurred in low-risk men only two in low-risk women.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
For women and men who were not high risk the age-sex standardized coronary heart disease rate was 62% lower than for high-risk participants.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Blood pressure need for antihypertensive medication smoking hyperglycemia diabetes total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independently related to coronary heart disease risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
CONCLUSIONS: Favorable levels of all modifiable readily measured risk factors - rare among Italian adults - assure minimal coronary heart disease risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Population-wide prevention is needed especially improved lifestyles to increase the proportion of the population at low risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Background:,Bergman 2015.txt,0
We describe the relationship between dysglycemia and long-term mortality and elucidate the relationship between blood glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and haemoglobin A1 (HbA1) and mortality.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Methods: A cohort of 1410 individuals was followed for 33 years since 1980.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Fasting and post-OGTT glucose parameters were used to categorize the cohort according to baseline glycemic status.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Results:,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The mortality rate increased from 43% in normoglycemic individuals to 53.3 61.7 72.9 and 88.0% in those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) IFG/IGT and diabetes respectively.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The highest mortality rate compared with the normoglycemic category was observed in individuals with IFG/IGT and diabetes according to a Cox proportional hazard model (HR = 1.38 95%CI 1.10-1.74 and HR = 2.14 95%CI 1.70-2.70 respectively) followed by individuals with IGT and IFG but this did not reach statistical significance.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
We speculate that the IFG group may represent a mixture of individuals en route from normal to the next two categories as well as another cohort whose glucose levels are stably set at the upper reaches of the normal distribution.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Significant differences were found between 1 and 2 h glucose values (p < 0.001).,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Fasting 60 and 120 min glucose values were positively associated with increasing HbA1 quintiles (p < 0.05).,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The mean HbA1 was significantly higher in those who died (p = 0.01).,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The highest mortality (58.8%) was observed in the upper HbA1 quintile that was also associated with the highest prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (17.2%).,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Conclusions:,Bergman 2015.txt,0
This study shows a continuous relationship between the severity of dysglycemia and long-term mortality and should promote the early recognition of prediabetes.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The 1 h post-load glucose level was continuously associated with increasing HbA1 concentrations and may therefore serve as an early marker for abnormalities in glucose tolerance.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
An elevated 1 h post-load glucose level may potentially identify at-risk individuals well before the traditional 2 h glucose value.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Aim: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be an etiologic cause of aging hypertension diabetes mellitus (DM) and metabolic syndrome.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
However the influence of these cardiovascular risk factors and their combination on the development of CKD remains controversial.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
This retrospective study evaluated the influence of cardiovascular risk factors and their combination on the incidence of CKD during a 6-year follow-up period in middle-aged and older males.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Methods:,Michishita 2017.txt,0
The subjects were 303 males without a history of cardiovascular disease stroke renal dysfunction or dialysis treatment.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
A biochemical analysis blood pressure (BP) analysis and anthropometry measurements were performed every year and the classification of CKD was also assessed based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and/or presence of proteinuria.,Michishita 2017.txt,1
Results: After 6 years the incidence of CKD was noted in 32 subjects.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
According to a multivariable analysis hypertension (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.95 95% confidence of interval [CI]: 1.64-9.49 p = 0.002) and hyperglycemia (HR: 3.27 95% CI: 1.42-7.56 p = 0.006) were significantly associated with the incidence of CKD.,Michishita 2017.txt,1
According to a Cox proportional hazards model the HR for the incidence of CKD was significantly higher in the combination of high-normal BP/hypertension and impaired fasting glucose/DM group than in the combination of normotensive and normal glucose tolerance group (HR: 7.16 95% CI: 2.43-17.25 p = 0.001).,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Conclusions:,Michishita 2017.txt,0
These results suggest that the hypertension and hyperglycemia and their combination may be associated with the incidence of CKD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Objectives: Data have indicated low to non-existent increased mortality risk for individuals with prediabetes but it is unclear if the risk is increased when the patient has elevated iron markers.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Our purpose was to examine the mortality risk among adults with prediabetes in the context of coexisting elevated transferrin saturation (TS) or serum ferritin.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Setting: Data collected by the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988-1994 (NHANES III) in the USA and by the National Center for Health Statistics for the National Death Index from 1988 to 2006.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Participants: Individuals age 40 and older who participated in the NHANES and provided a blood sample.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Primary outcome variable: Mortality was measured as all-cause mortality.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Results: Adjusted analyses show that prediabetes has a small increased mortality risk (HR=1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08).,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Persons who had prediabetes and elevated serum ferritin had an increased HR for death (HR=1.14; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24) compared with those who had normal ferritin and normal glucose.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Among persons with prediabetes who had elevated TS they had an increased mortality risk (HR=1.88; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.30) compared with those with normal TS levels and normal glucose.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Conclusions:,Mainous 2014.txt,0
The mortality risk of prediabetes is low.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
However among individuals who have coexisting elevated iron markers particularly TS the risk rises substantially.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Objective: HbA1c levels are increasingly measured in screening for diabetes; we investigated whether HbA1c may simultaneously improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment using QRISK3 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) scoring systems.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
"Research design and methods: UK Biobank participants without baseline CVD or known diabetes ( n = 357,833) were included.",Welsh 2020.txt,0
Associations of HbA1c with CVD was assessed using Cox models adjusting for classical risk factors.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Predictive utility was determined by the C-index and net reclassification index (NRI).,Welsh 2020.txt,0
"A separate analysis was conducted in 16,596 participants with known baseline diabetes.",Welsh 2020.txt,0
Results:,Welsh 2020.txt,0
"Incident fatal or nonfatal CVD as defined in the QRISK3 prediction model occurred in 12,877 participants over 8.9 years.",Welsh 2020.txt,1
"Of participants 3.3% ( n = 11,665) had prediabetes (42.0-47.9 mmol/mol [6.0-6.4%]) and 0.7% ( n = 2,573) had undiagnosed diabetes (≥48.0 mmol/mol [≥6.5%]).",Welsh 2020.txt,1
In unadjusted models compared with the reference group (<42.0 mmol/mol [<6.0%]) those with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were at higher CVD risk: hazard ratio (HR) 1.83 (95% CI 1.69-1.97) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.96-2.60) respectively.,Welsh 2020.txt,1
After adjustment for classical risk factors these attenuated to HR 1.11 (95% CI 1.03-1.20) and 1.20 (1.04-1.38) respectively.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Adding HbA1c to the QRISK3 CVD risk prediction model (C-index 0.7392) yielded a small improvement in discrimination (C-index increase of 0.0004 [95% CI 0.0001-0.0007]).,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The NRI showed no improvement.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Results were similar for models based on the ACC/AHA and SCORE risk models.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Conclusions:,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The near twofold higher unadjusted risk for CVD in people with prediabetes is driven mainly by abnormal levels of conventional CVD risk factors.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
While HbA1c adds minimally to cardiovascular risk prediction those with prediabetes should have their conventional cardiovascular risk factors appropriately measured and managed.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are considered one of the main causes of mortality and life-threatening morbidity worldwide.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
1 In communities with higher prevalence of CVDs uncontrolled potential risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus may lead to higher mortality and morbidity.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
1 Even a slight change in blood pressure or insulin resistance has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of significant mortality and adverse cardiac events in patients from such communities.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
2 In this regard the two clinical conditions of pre-hypertension or prediabetes are not only the precursors to systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus but can also increase the susceptibility to develop coronary atherosclerosis.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
In this context the combination of these two predisposing factors is more likely to lead to severe coronary artery disease (CAD) than expected with either one alone.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
3 According to recent reports regarding the high prevalence of these two clinically risky conditions in some countries their potential role in CVD occurrence should be considered.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
In two large surveys in the United States and South Korea the overall prevalence of pre-hypertension was 30% of the general populations.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
"4,5",Khosravi 2017.txt,0
The prevalence of pre-diabetes has been estimated in the range of 15.5% in Eastern countries up to 35% in Western countries and in Iran it is 13%.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
"6,7",Khosravi 2017.txt,0
It seems that the prevalence of these conditions may be higher than the reported ranges because of the unawareness of the majority of affected individuals of their risk.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
8 The underlying pathophysiological causes related to prehypertension and pre-diabetes leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disorders remain unknown.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
It has been suggested that individuals with these clinical conditions have the same risk factors such as insulin resistance hypertension hyperlipidemia obesity low physical activity endothelial dysfunction abnormal coagulative state and inflammatory conditions as those linked to increased risk of cardiovascular events.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
9 Despite the demonstrated role of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes in possible progress to hypertension and diabetes mellitus as well as their status as risk factors for atherosclerotic events it has remained unclear which of these conditions can predict cardiovascular events more effectively.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
The present study aimed to assess the impact of prediabetes and pre-hypertension separately and in combination to predict unstable angina (UA) myocardial infarction (MI) brain stroke sudden cardiac death (SCD) and CVD (consisting either of UA MI brain stroke or SCD) in a large longitudinal cohort in Iran.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
This research was based on a large longitudinal cohort study begun in 2001.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
With the use of a random multistage cluster sampling a large sample was originally selected from urban and rural population of 19 years and older from Isfahan Najafabad and Arak at the central part of Iran and was followed for 10 years.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
The detailed methods sampling and measurements and population characteristics were previously presented.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
[8][9][10][11][12],Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Patients with metabolic and inflammatory disorders and those administered by any agents affecting their carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms were excluded from the study.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
At the baseline all the participants were void of CVD or any kidney disease.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Before collecting the data each participant offered his/her written informed consent.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
The research committee at Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Institute as a collaborating centre of WHO approved the protocol.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
By the use of a validated questionnaire including demographic features socioeconomic information history of medications and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases the trained medical personnel collected the baseline data.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Furthermore measurements of body weight and height were done on a calibrated beam scale and wall-mounted stadiometer barefoot to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm respectively.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Then body weight (kg) was divided by height (m 2 ) to obtain body mass index.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Also some questions concerning current smoking and dietary and lifestyle habits were asked to identify the presence of any cardiovascular risk factors.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Those involved in regular smoking of a tobacco product once or more times per day or at any time in the past 30 days were defined as the smokers in this research; 12 hypercholesterolaemia as total cholesterol ⩾ 5.0 mmol l − 1  high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ⩾ 1.0 mmol l − 1 in males or ⩾ 1.1 mmol l − 1 in females and triglycerides ⩾,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
2.0 mmol l − 1 ; 13 positive first-degree family history of CAD in men and women o55 and 65 years old respectively; 14 hypertension as being on antihypertensive treatment and/or systolic blood pressure of ⩾ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of ⩾ 90 mm Hg; 15 and symptoms of diabetes mellitus associated with at least a plasma glucose concentration of ⩾ 11.1 mmol l − 1  fasting plasma glucose of ⩾ 7.0 mmol/l or 2 hpp ⩾ 11.1 mmol/l.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
16 A systolic blood pressure of 120-139 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 80-89 mm Hg was/were determined as a prehypertension case.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
3 Fasting blood glucose levels of 100-125 mg dl − 1 as impaired fasting glucose and/or 2-h postprandial (2 hpp) blood glucose levels of 140-199 mg dl − 1 after a load of 75 g oral glucose as impaired glucose tolerance were the criteria for pre-diabetes diagnosis according to American Diabetes Association.,Khosravi 2017.txt,1
17 Occurrences of brain stroke UA MI SCD and CVD within a follow-up period of 9 years were considered as acute cardiovascular outcomes in this cohort study.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Every 2 years the participants were asked briefly about any CVD occurrences through phone calls.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
All the measurements were repeated every 5 years.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
This cohort follow-up procedure is explained in detail elsewhere.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
8 The most recently published studies on the prevalence of prehypertension and pre-diabetes in various Middle Eastern countries were reviewed as well.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Surveys on normal populations were considered and specific age groups and communities were excluded from the review.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Chi-square and one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) tests were employed to compare the percentages between categorical variables and across quantitative variables respectively.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0

Authors of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 1 concluded that prior to the development of diabetes no study consistently found that elevated fasting glucose level could predict coronary heart disease (CHD) events.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Similarly results of a population-based prospective study 2 found that hazard ratios (HRs) for CHD risk were generally modest and non-significant across tenths of glucose values below 7.0 mmol/L.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Consistent with these observations were the findings of Steele et al. 3 that the prevalence of macrovascular disease in individuals with glucokinase mutations and prolonged hyperglycemia was no different than in a control population and lower when compared to young-onset patients with type 2 diabetes.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
In addition patients with glucokinase mutations had lower blood pressure (BP) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations and higher concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as compared to patients with diabetes leading to the conclusion that isolated hyperglycemia is rarely associated with macrovascular disease.,Salazar 2016.txt,0

These findings led them to conclude the association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance.,Salazar 2016.txt,0

Silent myocardial ischaemia was described in 1974 by Stern [1] who observed a prevalence of 46% of silent myocardial ischaemia in subjects with typical angina pectoris.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
Studying silent myocardial ischaemia is relevant because approximately one half of the first coronary heart events including sudden cardiac death occurs in asymptomatic individuals [2].,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
"It has been demonstrated that the majority of new ischaemic episodes in patients with established coronary artery disease are not associated with angina [3,4] and that 10-15% of new myocardial infarctions are silent [5].",Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
In subjects with known coronary artery disease the presence of silent myocardial ischaemia is associated with a poor prognosis displaying a 3.5-fold increased risk of an additional major cardiovascular event compared with patients with coronary artery disease without silent myocardial ischaemia [6].,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
"The prognostic significance of silent myocardial ischaemia as detected by Holter monitoring in asymptomatic subjects without known coronary artery disease is poorly evaluated [7,8].",Intzilakis 2012.txt,1

Prevalence and prognosis of subjects with both silent myocardial ischaemia and impaired fasting glucose has not been evaluated before but may be of interest as it may identify a subgroup with a high risk that may be subject for more intensive prevention and treatment.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
In the present study the association between silent myocardial ischaemia and the pre-diabetic state defined as impaired fasting glucose was investigated in healthy middle-aged and elderly subjects aged 55-75 years with no previous heart disease.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a marker of glycemia reflecting the average plasma glucose concentration over the previous 8e12 weeks [1].,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
It has been extensively applied for the monitoring and control of diabetes mellitus and was recently introduced as a diagnostic test defining a pre-diabetic state and overt diabetes at 5.7% and 6.5% respectively [1].,Rebnord 2015.txt,1
The INTERHEART study of multiple ethnicities showed a strong doseeresponse relationship between HbA1c and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) independent of the presence of selfreported diabetes [2].,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
"Further elevated HbA1c levels even within the pre-diabetic range have been associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations [3,4].",Rebnord 2015.txt,1
However it is not established whether the associations to macrovascular disease reflect glucose levels per se or is related to the frequent co-occurrence of pre-diabetes with the metabolic syndrome [5].,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
"Interestingly low HbA1c levels have also been associated with increased risk of mortality [4,6] although results have been inconsistent [7] and underlying mechanisms remain unknown.",Rebnord 2015.txt,0
The prognostic implications of HbA1c levels in patients without diabetes but with pre-existent coronary artery disease (CAD) have not been extensively evaluated.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
Associations of HbA1c to all-cause mortality have been demonstrated in such patients [8] but it is not clear whether the unfavorable prognosis is attributable to CVD [9].,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
We therefore aimed to evaluate the relations of HbA1c levels with risk of major coronary events CVD mortality and all-cause mortality in a large cohort of patients without diabetes referred to coronary angiography for suspected stable angina pectoris (SAP).,Rebnord 2015.txt,0

Whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are associated with the prospective development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been fully elucidated.,Fox 2005.txt,1
Data from cross-sectional studies show that alterations in glucose metabolism and hyperinsulinemia are associated with impaired kidney function (11)(12)(13).,Fox 2005.txt,0
"However the association of clinically relevant glycemic disease categories as defined by the American Diabetes Association (14,15) with CKD has not been established.",Fox 2005.txt,1
The finding that declines in kidney function are present early on among subjects with glucose intolerance could help direct therapeutic interventions to prevent the progression of kidney disease.,Fox 2005.txt,0

Patients who suffered a stroke at young age are at high risk of recurrent vascular events and death [1][2][3].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Because of the young age of these patients the initial stroke as well as possible recurrent vascular events have a large impact on number of years lost to illhealth disability and early death.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
"Previous studies reported that vascular risk factors are common in these young adults [4,5].",Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Secondary prevention measures targeting these vascular risk factors may diminish the risk of recurrent vascular events.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
However risk factors that emerge after a young stroke often may go undetected in many patients as current protocols and guidelines only recommend screening of young stroke patients in the acute phase and only few months thereafter [6].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Risk of recurrent vascular events seems especially high in young stroke patients with a medical history of diabetes [7].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
"In both the general population and in stroke patients over 65 years also impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance conditions that precede diabetes have been associated with an increased risk of vascular events [8,9].",Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,1
Moreover more than half of older stroke patients who were not previously known to have diabetes was diagnosed to have either impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes three months after stroke [10].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,1
Analogous to these older stroke patients young stroke patients without a medical history of diabetes at the time of their index event may still develop IFG or incident diabetes after their young stroke as well.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Particularly since regular monitoring of glucose levels after the acute phase of stroke in young adults without diabetes is seldom performed.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Glucose control in patients with IFG or incident diabetes could be an important way to reduce risk of recurrent vascular events [11].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
However the incidence of diabetes and IFG after stroke in young adults is currently unknown.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Moreover we are not aware of any study that investigates the association between impaired fasting blood glucose and recurrent vascular events in young stroke patients.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Therefore we first investigated the incidence of diabetes after a mean follow-up of 10 years in survivors of a young TIA or ischemic stroke.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Secondly we investigated whether impaired fasting blood glucose and diabetes at follow-up were associated with the occurrence of vascular events during follow-up.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0

A causal relationship between metabolic syndrome and the development of CKD however has not been reported.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
A recent longitudinal study in adults in the United States indicated that metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for CKD (10).,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
"The effect of obesity on glucose tolerance differs among races but there are few published data specifically for an Asian population (11,12).",Tozawa 2007.txt,0

Over the past thirty years the mortality rate from coronary heart disease has fallen dramatically in the United States.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
This decline has been more pronounced in men than women 1.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
However the population with type 2 diabetes has failed to share in this decline 2 .,Donahue 2011.txt,0
While both primary prevention as well as secondary preventive efforts no doubt lies behind much of the decline in the non-diabetic population the lack of improvement among the diabetic population is puzzling.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Extant data suggest that women with diabetes are more likely to have recurrent CVD than men 3.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Few data are available that have examined potential sex differences in the effects of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100-125 mg/dl) on recurrent cardiovascular events though it is known that diabetes is an especially important risk factor among women 4 and that risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women may be elevated at lower glucose levels than for men 5 -6.,Donahue 2011.txt,1
To examine the role of IFG in terms of secondary prevention we hypothesized that IFG among those discharged alive after suffering an initial acute MI (AMI) would be at higher risk for recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) than their normoglycemic counterparts with potential sex differences.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
The Western New York Acute MI study is an on-going study of residents of Erie and Niagara Counties who were hospitalized at area hospitals with confirmed AMI.,Donahue 2011.txt,0

Diagnosed DM was defined as a self-reported diagnosis that was determined previously by a specialist or patients were being treated with hypoglycemic medications currently.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Undiagnosed DM and pre-DM was defined according to the American Diabetes Association criteria.,Liu 2018.txt,1
1 Undiagnosed DM was confirmed by a fasting plasma glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) 2-hour glucose level ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level ≥6.5%.,Liu 2018.txt,1
1 Total DM was the sum of the number of patients with diagnosed DM and undiagnosed DM. Pre-DM was diagnosed as any participants who did not have DM but had a fasting plasma glucose ranges from 5.6 to <7.0 mmol/L (100-126 mg/dL) 2-hour glucose ranges from 7.8 to <11.1 mmol/L (140-200 mg/dL) or HbA1c level ranges from 5.7% to <6.5%.,Liu 2018.txt,1

Diagnosed hypertension was defined as a self-reported hypertension and currently taking antihypertensive drugs.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Undiagnosed hypertension was defined according to the JNC-7 and 2017 ACC/ AHA guidelines respectively.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Based on the JNC-7 criteria patients with systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg were diagnosed with hypertension.,Liu 2018.txt,1
12 According to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline patients with systolic BP ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg were defined as having hypertension.,Liu 2018.txt,1

In recent years an important conceptual advance has been introduced concerning the major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors: the focus is no longer exclusively on their adverse effects but also on protective effects of favorable levels of all readily measured modifiable major coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors namely low risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Low-risk persons are rare in the general population and therefore research on the impact of low risk requires large cohorts followed long-term.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Available data indicate that for low risk substrata CVD particularly CHD is rare and endemic not epidemic throughout adulthood.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
These findings come from only three studies however all of US cohorts [1][2][3][4][5].,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
The possibility that low-risk protects against CHD is important since CHD remains a major cause of morbidity disability and death (European Health for All Database website: http://www.WHO.dk/hfadb).,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
In this study we assessed the impact of low risk on 10-year CHD incidence in 20 447 women and men at baseline ages of 35-69 years from the Italian longitudinal study the Progetto CUORE [6].,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Prediabetes comprising impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is frequently undetected and associated with an increased risk for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1].,Bergman 2015.txt,1

Threshold levels for dysglycemic states are defined by absolute fasting plasma glucose (FPG) a 2 h glucose value during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or glycohemoglobin (Hb1Ac) criteria.,Bergman 2015.txt,1
An International Expert Committee (IEC) in 2009 recommended that a haemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c ) threshold of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) could also be used for diagnosing diabetes a position adopted by both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) [2].,Bergman 2015.txt,1
Furthermore the diagnosis of prediabetes defined by a HbA 1c value between 5.7 and 6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol) was accepted by the ADA but not WHO.,Bergman 2015.txt,1
The IEC defined a lower risk category for developing type 2 diabetes in those with a HbA 1c ≥ 5.7-5.9% (39-41 mmol/mol) and a higher risk category in those with HbA 1c ≥ 6.0-6.4% (42-46 mmol/mol).,Bergman 2015.txt,1
"The use of HbA 1c for screening and diagnosing dyglycemic states has recently been reviewed and remains controversial [3,4].",Bergman 2015.txt,0
The current study is based on longitudinal data from the Israel Study of Glucose Intolerance Obesity and Hypertension (The Israel GOH Study).,Bergman 2015.txt,0
In the 1980s it was accepted that although HbA 1c correlated best with the average blood glucose concentration over preceding months for clinical purposes however the measurement of total HbA1 could be substituted.,Bergman 2015.txt,0

The aim of CKD treatment is not only to improve the renal function but also to prevent the development of ESRD and CVD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
However at present the influence of these cardiovascular risk factors alone and in combination on the development of CKD remains controversial despite the fact that the accumulation of above risk factors has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (8)(9)(10).,Michishita 2017.txt,0
We therefore hypothesized that the above cardiovascular risk factors and their combination might predict the incidence of CKD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
The clarification of the influence of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity hypertension dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia and their combination on the incidence of CKD may highlight the importance of CKD prevention.,Michishita 2017.txt,0

Further recent evidence suggests that among patients with diabetes mortality risk increases in the presence of elevated ferritin or elevated TS. 23 24,Mainous 2014.txt,0
We therefore hypothesise that the mortality risk of individuals with prediabetes will be increased in the presence of elevated iron markers.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Considering that only about 10% of the US population with prediabetes realise that they have prediabetes a better understanding of the potential mortality risk is warranted.,Mainous 2014.txt,0

The use of a cut point of GFR Ͻ60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 classified 50% more women as having kidney disease than men so we modified the K/DOQI definition and reclassified kidney disease as a GFR at or below the sex-specific 5th percentile (59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in women and 64 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in men).,Fox 2005.txt,1

CONCLUSIONS,Fox 2005.txt,0
-The risk of developing chronic kidney disease associated with pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes is largely accounted for by coexisting vascular disease risk factors.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Similarly vascular disease risk factors attenuated most of the relationship between insulin resistance and CKD.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Gradation of risk for CKD appears to be linear across the spectrum of glycemic status and known diabetes is a strong and independent risk factor for CKD.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Our findings suggest that concomitant vascular disease risk factors explain most of the increased odds of development of CKD seen among participants with IFG and newly diagnosed diabetes.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Traditionally diabetic nephropathy is thought to be a microvascular complication of diabetes characterized by the classic Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome lesion.,Fox 2005.txt,1
However it has been shown that less than one-third of patients with diabetes and increased urinary albumin excretion actually demonstrate this classic lesion (28).,Fox 2005.txt,1
Further evidence exists to suggest that classic diabetic lesions may not underlie kidney disease and diabetes in a substantial number of individuals.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Among adults with diabetes the prevalence of albuminuria is only 29% (29).,Fox 2005.txt,0
In a recent crosssectional survey using data from NHANES III 33% of diabetic adults with a GFR Ͻ60 ml/min per 1.73m 2 (CKD stages 3-5) (23) did not have evidence of either albuminuria (microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria) or retinopathy (30).,Fox 2005.txt,0
Taken together these data suggest that CKD in the setting of pre-diabetes might be thought of as an additional complication of macrovascular atherosclerosis.,Fox 2005.txt,0
These data add to the results of prior cross-sectional studies demonstrating that alterations of glucose metabolism and hyperinsulinemia are associated with impaired kidney function (11)(12)(13).,Fox 2005.txt,0
Data from NHANES III demonstrated an increased odds of CKD by increasing HOMA-IR across the spectrum of nondiabetic participants.,Fox 2005.txt,0
The most striking results come from those with HOMA-IR values in the upper quartile compared with those in the lower quartile (OR 2.65).,Fox 2005.txt,0
Differences from our study include the inclusion of in-  dividuals with IFG and the cross-sectional nature of the data.,Fox 2005.txt,0
In another crosssectional study of 321 individuals with untreated essential hypertension and hypertensive nephrosclerosis increased plasma glucose and insulin resistance were observed when creatinine clearance was Ͻ50 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (11).,Fox 2005.txt,0
However the patients in this study were untreated hypertensive patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis limiting the generalizability of these findings.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Further these authors did not adjust for concomitant vascular disease risk factors.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Our baseline cross-sectional data demonstrate increasing GFR values across the spectrum of hyperglycemia.,Fox 2005.txt,0
The most likely explanation for our cross-sectional findings comes from physiologic studies of kidney function which have demonstrated that GFR is elevated among individuals with IGT and newly diagnosed diabetes both at baseline and during at least 4 years of follow-up.,Fox 2005.txt,0
These findings are consistent with hyperfiltration in the early stages of diabetes.,Fox 2005.txt,0
In studies of the natural history of diabetic nephropathy among the Pima Indians GFRs at baseline among those with NGT IGT and newly diagnosed diabetes were 123 135 and 143 ml/min respectively.,Fox 2005.txt,0
At follow-up GFR further increased by 14% in subjects with IGT and by 18% in those with newly diagnosed diabetes whereas increases were not seen in those with diabetes of longer duration (31).,Fox 2005.txt,0
Thus this finding may explain why we did not see greater differences in mean GFR by baseline glycemic categories.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Of note in our data declines in GFR were the greatest among those with new or known diabetes whereas they were modest in those with NGT or IGT.,Fox 2005.txt,0
The strengths of our study include the use of a population-based sample not selected for diabetes CKD or vascular disease risk factors rigorous ascertainment and documentation of exposures and outcomes and longitudinal data with nearcomplete follow-up.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Some limitations to our work exist.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Our interval follow-up time of 7 years may have been insufficient to allow for the development of interim CKD among those with newly diagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes.,Fox 2005.txt,0
All participants were required to attend a baseline and follow-up examination.,Fox 2005.txt,0
It is likely that those with the most severe disease died or developed serious comorbidities impeding their ability to return for the follow-up examination.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Thus we may have incurred a survival bias in which we underestimated the effects of hyperglycemia on the development of CKD.,Fox 2005.txt,0
"We did not have information on microalbuminuria a known risk factor for the development of kidney disease in the setting of diabetes (31,32).",Fox 2005.txt,0
The inclusion of microalbuminuria had this information been available may have affected our results.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Specifically participants considered free of CKD may actually have proteinuria and therefore would have been misclassified.,Fox 2005.txt,0
This misclassification may have biased our results toward the null.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Lastly we had low power to detect differences in the development of CKD by glycemic category.,Fox 2005.txt,0
To have 80% power we needed ORs of 1.75 for IFG and IGT an OR of 2.84 among those with newly diagnosed diabetes and an OR of 2.34 among those with known diabetes.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Similarly for metabolic syndrome we needed an OR of 1.74 to detect differences in the development of CKD.,Fox 2005.txt,0
Therefore borderline P values may meet statistical significance in larger samples.,Fox 2005.txt,0

There was no difference in mean BMI for those with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Mean waist circumference was larger in women with abnormal glucose tolerance compared with the women with normal glucose tolerance but there was no difference in waist circumference for men in the two glucose subgroups.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
As expected mean FPG was lower among participants with normal glucose tolerance (96.0 Ϯ 10.4 mg/dl vs. 100.8 Ϯ 10.4 mg/dl; P Ͻ 0.001).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The mean HbA 1c levels were statistically but not clinically different between the two groups.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Of the nine variables that initially entered our multivariable logistic regression analysis only two demographic and two laboratory variables remained significantly associated with an abnormal PCPG result (Table 2).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Individuals aged Ն70 years had the highest odds of an abnormal PCPG test (OR 3.06; 95% CI 2.43-3.87).,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
Women had higher odds of abnormal PCPG (1.60; 1.26 -2.02) compared with men.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Participants with triglycerides Ն150 mg/dl and FPG Ն95 mg/dl were at greater risk for abnormal glucose tolerance as well.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The discrimination of the final model was modest in the derivation cohort (c ϭ 0.73 with continuous variables 0.71 with categorical variables).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Results did not differ with sex-specific models.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Using ␤-coefficients from the final categorical multivariate model we assigned points to each of the four risk factors for abnormal PCPG (Table 2).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
A risk score was calculated for each participant by summing the points of each risk factor that was present.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The derivation cohort risk score ranged from 0 to 7 points (2.6 Ϯ 1.4 [means Ϯ SD]).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Estimates of sensitivity specificity and positive likelihood ratios for each score for abnormal glucose tolerance are shown in Table 3.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
A score of 4 or higher could double the likelihood of an abnormal PCPG test.,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
To validate this rule we applied the prediction models and simple scoring rule to the baseline data from Health ABC.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The overall discrimination of the scoring system for abnormal PCPG was similar in both samples (c ϭ 0.70 in the derivation sample 0.66 in the validation sample).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Next we prospectively validated the prediction rule for incident diabetes in Health ABC.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
"There were 143 incident cases of diabetes over 5 years (14.1 cases/ 1,000 person-years).",Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The area under the ] [ROC curve for the multivariable model using continuous or categorical variables was not different than the scoring system (c ϭ 0.75 for both multivariable models 0.71 for the scoring system).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Thus the scoring system was able to discriminate incident diabetes cases equally well as the PCPG test.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
When we stratified the Health ABC cohort by race similar discrimination in both the black and white participants using the continuous model categorical model or scoring system was observed (Figure 1).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0

CONCLUSIONS,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
-We have developed a clinical prediction rule to identify persons with abnormal glucose tolerance that predicted diabetes equally well as the 2-h PCPG test.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Two demographic variables age and sex and two laboratory variables FPG and triglyceride levels were most strongly associated with abnormal glucose tolerance in a cohort of older white adults.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Using a simple scoring system a score of Ն4 points at least doubled the likelihood of an abnormal 2-h PCPG test result.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Moreover this scoring system validated in an independent cohort of black and white older adults was able to predict future diabetes with similar accuracy as the PCPG test.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Thus patients with a score of Ն4 points with this simple scoring rule should receive appropriate lifestyle or pharmacologic therapies in order to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
"Recent reports that the incidence of diabetes can be prevented or delayed in individuals with IGT by lifestyle intervention (5,6) or medication therapy (5,12,13) has highlighted the need for identification of these high-risk individuals.",Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) does not recommend the 2-h PCPG test for screening or diagnosis of diabetes because the test is costly inconvenient and has poor reproducibility (7).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
"The ADA adopted the term of ""prediabetes"" to identify persons with IGT or impaired fasting glucose (IFG; FPG levels between 110 -125 mg/dl) collectively as those at highest risk for developing diabetes.",Kanaya 2005.txt,1
"In 2003 the ADA revised the definition for IFG to include persons with fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl (14,15).",Kanaya 2005.txt,1
The use of IFG alone to identify those with incident diabetes in our validation cohort had a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 82% (ROC area of 0.68).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
We found that the addition of age sex and triglyceride level to elevated FPG results increased the predictive accuracy for diabetes.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Several recent studies have evaluated the utility of laboratory and demographic variables for predicting incident diabetes.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Stern et al. (8) reported the effectiveness of eight clinical variables at predicting those at risk of incident diabetes among the San Antonio Heart Study participants.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The prediction equation they created was based mostly on continuous variables and requires the use of a computer or personal digital assistant to implement.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Additionally being Mexican American explained most of the predictive value of their equation.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
This clinical model was tested in a cohort of Japanese Americans and was useful in predicting diabetes risk in younger Japanese Americans after 5-6 years but was not useful in older participants or with longer follow-up (16).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Another study that calculated a diabetes risk score utilized data from a Finnish population sample (17).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The authors found seven demographic and questionnaire variables that predicted future drugtreated diabetes with ROC curve area of 0.85 and 0.87 in two consecutive cohorts.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
As with the San Antonio study clinical model the Finnish model requires the use of a computer to calculate the risk score and has not been validated in different ethnic groups.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The present study differs from these prior studies in that it was first a cross-sectional evaluation of predictors of abnormal glucose tolerance in one sample and then was prospectively validated for diabetes prediction in a separate cohort.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Moreover this prediction rule was derived and validated in separate samples of different racial makeup and was based on only four variables that could be calculated easily without the use of a computerized program.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
"""Clinical decision rules attempting to refine the accuracy of clinicians diagnostic and prognostic ability are widely re- ported.",Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Using criteria developed to grade the evidence for clinical decision rules (10) our study is limited in its applicability because we validated it only in the Health ABC study with well-functioning adults older than age 70.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
The age criterion for our prediction rule was met by every Health ABC participant so age was uninformative.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
This may have weakened both the sensitivity and specificity of the rule in the validation cohort.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
This prediction rule needs to be validated prospectively in broader populations.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Clinicians may consider using this rule if the patients in their c l i n i c a l s e t t i n g a r e o l d e r  w e l lfunctioning black or white adults.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
However the risk of a lifestyle intervention for those identified with abnormal glucose tolerance is low.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Lifestyle modification has been recommended as the first-line intervention to prevent or delay diabetes with the recommended goals of modest weight loss (5-10% of body weight) and modest physical activity (30 min daily) (18).,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
"Because this intervention is likely to have a variety of other benefits the ADA has urged health care providers to counsel all overweight or sedentary individuals to adopt these changes.""",Kanaya 2005.txt,0
We found that measures of adiposity such as BMI or waist circumference were not independently associated with abnormal glucose tolerance.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
We did not expect to find an association between BMI and glucose intolerance because BMI is a poor marker for total adiposity in older adults (19).,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
But abdominal adiposity has been more closely linked with adverse metabolic consequences and has been suggested to precede insulin resistance (20).,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
Waist circumference is an accepted criterion in the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome but waist circumference may reflect total body fat better than visceral fat in older adults (21).,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
It is possible that in our derivation cohort waist circumference did not adequately represent visceral obesity explaining the lack of association of waist circumference with glucose intolerance.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
In conclusion advanced age female sex FPG and triglycerides had good ability to predict those with abnormal glucose tolerance.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
A score of 4 or higher doubled the likelihood of an abnormal postchallenge glucose test result.,Kanaya 2005.txt,1
This rule could help clinicians to better identify individuals with abnormal glucose tolerance who should be targeted for interventions to prevent diabetes.,Kanaya 2005.txt,0
Subject groups defined by baseline glucose determinations were compared between glucose levels less than 100 mg/dL and glucose of 100 to 125 mg/dL.,Nielson 2007.txt,1
As shown in Table 1 characteristics of the groups were similar although the higher glucose groups had slightly greater age body mass index and blood pressure.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Over the average 6-to 7-year period of care following an initial glucose determination higher glucose was associated with greater occurrence of TIA or stroke.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Of patients with glucose under 100 mg/dL 1.8% suffered an event in contrast to 2.4% of patients with glucose 100 to 126 mg/dL revealing a 31% greater frequency (P < .001).,Nielson 2007.txt,0
The incidence rate increased from 3.9 cases per 1000 patient-years (baseline glucose < 100 mg/dL) to 5.3 cases/1000 patient-years (glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL P < .001).,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Thus a new diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease including TIA and stroke was significantly more frequent when the baseline morning glucose was 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.5 to 7 mM) in contrast to under 100 mg/dL (Figure 1).,Nielson 2007.txt,1
Kaplan-Meier survival/morbidity analysis showed that patients with higher baseline glucose had a progressive increase in incidence of cerebrovascular disease over a period of 8 years (Figure 2).,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk of elevated glucose in the context of additional factors associated with coronary disease.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Without correction for covariates a Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that baseline glucose over 100 mg/dL was associated with a significant risk for CVD (hazard ratio 1.35 95% CI 1. 15 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers).,Nielson 2007.txt,1
Age body mass index creatinine LDL HDL and triglycerides were analyzed as continuous variables.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Cox regression analysis of 28 477 records comprising 100 982 years at risk and 593 instances of new TIA or stroke demonstrated increased risk for CVD (hazard ratio 1.24 95% CI 1.05-1.46 P = .01) after corrections.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
For diabetes age-and sex-adjusted and multivariateadjusted HRs for overall CVD major IHD events major CVD events stroke and all-cause mortality were significantly higher using all three criteria (Table 2).,Kim_2016.txt,1

In our study the significant association between pre-hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular events may be due to great coronary microvascular dysfunction in the patients studied.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in its field among the Middle Eastern countries.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Moreover many Middle Eastern countries lack sufficient data regarding the prevalence of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
However as in Table 3 [18][19][20][21] and Table 4 [22][23][24][25][26][27][28] the prevalence of pre-hypertension and prediabetes of other countries in the region is relatively comparable to that found in Iran considering the growing rate of this incidence in these regions.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0
Despite the diversity and inequalities found in Middle Eastern countries they still have several health issues in common.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0

In conclusion our data provide valuable evidence of the triggering role for the combination of pre-hypertension and prediabetes in predicting myocardial infarction and pre-hypertension in the occurrence of unstable angina and cardiovascular diseases even in apparently healthy individuals.,Khosravi 2017.txt,0

The association of prediabetes with the risk of kidney disease has not been consistent across studies.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Some studies have suggested an increased risk of kidney disease among participants with prediabetes although most of those were cross-sectional (23)(24)(25)(26).,Neves 2020.txt,0

In a post hoc analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) impaired fasting glucose was also not associated with a higher incidence of CKD incident albuminuria or worsening kidney function (27).,Neves 2020.txt,1
A meta-analysis of 9 cohort studies reported a modest increased risk of CKD development in participants with prediabetes but there was a significant heterogeneity across the included studies and a limited adjustment for potential confounders (28).],Neves 2020.txt,0
[Few studies have assessed the effects of prediabetes in participants with CKD at baseline.,Neves 2020.txt,0
A cohort study of 1165 adults with nondialysis CKD stages 1 to 5 and without diabetes (29) reported that HbA1c in the prediabetes range was not associated with increased progression to ESRD.,Neves 2020.txt,0
In our study although prediabetes was not associated with the composite renal outcome it was associated with a higher risk of proteinuria progression.,Neves 2020.txt,1
The use of change in albuminuria or proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint for progression of CKD and increased risk of ESRD in clinical trials has recently gained support (30).,Neves 2020.txt,0
In diabetic kidney disease hyperfiltration and proteinuria are proposed to be the early clinical manifestations of kidney damage (31).,Neves 2020.txt,1
We hypothesize that in patients with nondiabetic CKD prediabetes might also contribute to hyperfiltration glomerular dysfunction and proteinuria.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Although prediabetes was not associated with eGFR decrease or ESRD with a median follow-up of 7.5 years it might have contributed to these outcomes if the follow-up had been longer.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Furthermore proteinuria has been associated with increased CV risk (32) suggesting the possibility that the increased risk of adverse CV outcomes in our study may have been partly mediated by the proteinuria progression.,Neves 2020.txt,1
Many mechanistic theories have been postulated to explain the association of prediabetes with higher CV risk.,Neves 2020.txt,0
These include associations with endothelial dysfunction (33) changes in myocardial substrate utilization (34) microvascular dysfunction (35) increased in proinflammatory cytokines (36) impaired fibrinolysis and hypercoagulability (37).,Neves 2020.txt,1
However in the general population the association of prediabetes with adverse CV events is not consistent.,Neves 2020.txt,0
"Some studies have suggested an increased CV risk (38,39) while other have not found significant associations (40,41) suggesting that the CV risk may be dependent on the population studied.",Neves 2020.txt,0
Perhaps the most robust observational evidence comes from a meta-analysis including 53 prospective cohort studies which reported that prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of composite CV events coronary heart disease stroke and all-cause mortality (42).,Neves 2020.txt,1
Importantly most studies evaluated in this metaanalysis included only a small portion of patients with CKD.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Regarding patients with CKD in a study by Huang et al. including non-dialysis CKD participants without diabetes HbA1c values in the prediabetes range were associated with increased all-cause mortality (adverse CV events were not assessed in this study) (29).,Neves 2020.txt,1
In this study HbA1c was associated with increased mortality even after adjustment for fasting glucose levels (29).,Neves 2020.txt,0
The observation in our study that prediabetes defined by hemoglobin HbA1c but not defined by fasting plasma glucose was associated with increased risk of adverse CV outcomes suggests that HbA1c may be a better predictor of CV events in patients with CKD.,Neves 2020.txt,1
Interestingly in our study there was evidence for effect modification of the association of prediabetes with all-cause mortality according to baseline eGFR such that the association appeared to be restricted to those with higher baseline eGFR.,Neves 2020.txt,0
This suggests that while prediabetes may be an important risk factor for all-cause mortality in early phases of CKD in patients with more advanced CKD (and higher CV risk) prediabetes may not further increase the risk of mortality.,Neves 2020.txt,0
In our study prediabetes was also associated with a higher risk of peripheral artery disease events which is in agreement with previous reports in the general population (38).,Neves 2020.txt,1
However the component of the composite CV outcome that was more strongly associated with prediabetes was heart failure.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Our results are consistent with the higher risk of heart failure in prediabetes reported in the general population (43).,Neves 2020.txt,0
Furthermore in the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Community Study (ARIC) including participants without prevalent CV disease prediabetes was associated with increased left ventricular mass diastolic dysfunction and subtle reduction in left ventricular systolic function (44).,Neves 2020.txt,1
The identification of prediabetes as a risk factor for heart failure in CKD is important given the high incidence of heart failure in this group (45).,Neves 2020.txt,1

"Recently SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to decrease the risk of adverse CV and renal outcomes in diabetes (46,47).",Neves 2020.txt,0

Whether treatment with SGLT2 can also reduce adverse CV and renal outcomes in patients with CKD and prediabetes is unknown.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Our finding that diabetes is associated with higher risk for adverse CV and CKD progression is concordant with most previous studies (48)(49)(50)(51).,Neves 2020.txt,1
Regarding the strengths of our study we performed an analysis of a large prospective cohort with rigorous data collection.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Furthermore we evaluated an ethnically and racially diverse population of participants with varying stages of CKD with adjudicated renal and CV outcomes.,Neves 2020.txt,0
There are limitations to our analysis.,Neves 2020.txt,0
First despite the adjustment for several biologically plausible confounders there may still be residual confounding due to the observational design.,Neves 2020.txt,0
We cannot exclude that some associations of prediabetes or diabetes with CV or renal outcomes could have been different if we were able to further reduce residual confounding.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Second the classification of prediabetes and diabetes was performed based on a single baseline analysis.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Although this approach is common in similar studies we cannot exclude the possibility of misclassification of some participants.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Third our classification of glucose metabolism status was based only on the fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Some participants might have been classified differently if the oral glucose tolerance test had also been evaluated.,Neves 2020.txt,0
Finally our study might have been not powered enough to detect small differences between prediabetes and normoglycemia regarding renal outcomes.,Neves 2020.txt,0
In summary in participants of CRIC prediabetes is common is not associated with an increased risk of eGFR decrease or ESRD development but is associated with proteinuria progression and an increased risk of adverse CV outcomes.,Neves 2020.txt,1
Given the high CV risk profile of patients with CKD future studies targeting risk reduction for individuals with CKD and prediabetes are warranted.,Neves 2020.txt,0

The results of this study demonstrate that elevated glucose in the absence of diabetes is associated with greater incidence of cerebrovascular disease independent of other recognized risk factors including age weight hyperlipidemia renal failure and hypertension.,Nielson 2007.txt,1
Both the relative risk for cerebrovascular disease and the progressive increase in incidence indicate that modest increases in blood glucose are associated with an increased incidence of TIA and stroke.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
These results extend previous descriptions of the association between elevated glucose and CVD and confirm that commonly used morning glucose determinations can provide a significant indication of CVD risk.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Studies of elevated glucose are commonly confounded by additional risk factors for CVD including age gender BMI renal failure hyperlipidemia and hypertension.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
One study that included diabetics showed an association of fasting glucose with risk for CVD after correction for covariants.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
3 Our results show that nondiabetic patients who have elevations in glucose above 100 mg/dL are at increased risk for CVD even after adjustment for multiple covariants.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Furthermore because glucose determinations were performed at least 1 year before a first diagnosis of CVD the results are consistent with the possibility that elevated glucose contributes to the pathogenesis of CVD.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Since elevated fasting glucose is an increasingly common problem it may be clinically useful to include consideration of glucose in addition to other better recognized risk factors including hyperlipidemia hypertension and obesity.,Nielson 2007.txt,1
The identification of elevated glucose as a risk factor is of interest both with respect to identification of patients at risk and possibly as a basis for treatment.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
"Although elevated fasting glucose and glucose intolerance have been associated with CVD 3,13 common covariates have not always been studied 2 and it remains unclear whether elevations in glucose contribute to disease pathogenesis.",Nielson 2007.txt,0
It is known that elevation of blood glucose can contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Elevated glucose induces nonenzymatic protein glycosylation protein kinase C activation and oxidative stress.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
15 Vascular disease may be related to endothelial dysfunction 16 proinflammatory changes 17 and a prothrombotic state.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
18 Since effects of glucose may not have a lower threshold modest changes in blood glucose could be of clinical significance.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Because elevations of glucose were independently associated with risk for future cerebrovascular events and mechanisms of glucose associated pathology are recognized it is plausible that interventions to control glucose even in nondiabetic patients could reduce TIA and stroke.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Control of postprandial hyperglycemia has been shown to improve carotid atherosclerosis 19 ; however there is little clinical evidence that improved glycemic control can reduce or prevent cerebrovascular events.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
Since consequences of stroke are severe small reductions in frequency that may be difficult to statistically detect are of clinical importance.,Nielson 2007.txt,0
In summary our data demonstrate the association of elevated glucose above 100 mg/dL with subsequent risk for TIA and stroke in the absence of diabetes.,Nielson 2007.txt,1
Although it remains unclear whether interventions to lower glucose can reduce risk elevated fasting glucose appears to be an additional indication for careful clinical evaluation with respect to cerebrovascular disease.,Nielson 2007.txt,1
This longitudinal analysis showed a significant association between diabetes and UMI but no association between IFG and UMI over eight years of follow-up.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
Our data suggest a potential dose response relationship between glucose status and risk of UMI where diabetes was associated with highest risk followed by prediabetes and normal glucose levels.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
While the results of the glucose tolerance test were not significant the most plausible explanation remains the imprecise nature of the ECG to fully capture those with an UMI.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
In comparing the patterns between fasting glucose status and the glucose tolerance test those with IFG were more closely associated with NFG while those with IGT behaved more like those found to have DM during their glucose tolerance test which parallels previous publications about the prognostication based on fasting glucose as opposed to glucose tolerance.,Stacey 2019.txt,0

One possible mechanism underlying the asymptomatic nature of many UMIs may be neuropathic either peripheral neuropathy or cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) particularly among people with diabetes.,Stacey 2019.txt,0

Several questions remain to help guide clinicians in developing strategies to further address the relationship between prediabetes and UMI.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
First which strategy would best serve to screen patients for UMI?,Stacey 2019.txt,0
While CMR represents the gold standard in infarct imaging for UMI 33 it lacks widespread availability and is cost-prohibitive on a public health scale.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
"While screening ECGs may not be as sensitive as CMR for detecting UMI they represent a highly cost-effective method of detecting MI. 49,50 Conversely since neuropathy seems to be under-diagnosed should screening for neuropathy be performed to determine who should undergo screening for UMI?",Stacey 2019.txt,0
While there are many parallels between recognized MI and UMI it is unclear at this point which intervention would serve best to specifically prevent UMI except for effective risk factor modification.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
While IFG was not independently associated with UMI in this elderly cohort it may have resulted from significant age-related glycosylation which would mean higher levels of glucose would be needed to further increase the risk.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
51 There are limitations related to this study.,Stacey 2019.txt,0
First a limiting factor in our analyses is the use of the 12-lead electrocardiogram to identify UMI.,Stacey 2019.txt,0

The potential mechanisms for this include (1) more prolonged glycaemic exposure in IGT compared with IFG due to post-load hyperglycaemia (2) higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in IGT patients and (3) greater diurnal fluctuations in plasma glucose due to higher 2h-PG may have a more damaging effect.,Chattopadhyay 2019.txt,0

"""Although incident CVD events occurred somewhat more commonly in subjects with PreDM as compared to NFG (Table 2) the difference did not reach conventional statistical significance.",Salazar 2016.txt,0
As such these findings are consistent with the results of large epidemiological studies as analysed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force 1 as well as the population-based findings of Sarwar et al. 2 that differences in plasma glucose concentration within the non-diabetic range do not predict CVD.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Furthermore  substituting the phrase insulin resistance for several conventional risk factors also renders our results congruent with the findings of the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration 4 that within a non-diabetic population information about differences in glucose concentrations per se did not significantly improve metrics of vascular disease prediction when added to information about several conventional risk factors.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
More simply said FPI concentration was more than twofold higher in the PreDM/IR subgroup (Table 2) and these individuals had significantly more CVD despite having FPG concentrations that were essentially identical to those in the PreDM/non-IR group.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Moreover in the Cox models an adjustment for FPG levels did not change the risk estimation.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Interestingly despite the differences in BMI between IR and non-IR PreDM individuals (Table 3) an adjustment for this variable did not modify substantially the HR value (Table 4).,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Our finding of the important role that differences in insulin sensitivity play in modulation of CVD risk in nondiabetic subjects is seemingly closest to the conclusion of Faerch et al. 5 that the association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
We also show that CVD is increased in the IR subset of patients with PreDM despite FPG concentrations that are not different from the non-IR patients.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Further support for the view that increase in incident CVD in PreDM is unlikely to be a simple function of enhanced glycaemia is evidence that patients with glucokinase deficiencies and many years of mild hyperglycaemia had essentially no increase in CVD when compared to a group of young patients with relatively mild type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).,Salazar 2016.txt,0
3,Salazar 2016.txt,0
The patients with glucokinase deficiencies also had lower BP levels and lower TG and higher HDL-C concentrations than the young patients with T2DM similar to the differences in CVD risk factors between the PreDM/non-IR and PreDM/IR groups in this study.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Compared with NFG/non-IR NFG/IR individuals showed an unfavourable risk profile characterized for high TG and low HDL-C levels but given the scanty number of NFG subjects defined as IR and the relatively few CVD events the results of the analysis did not identify a significant increase in CVD events.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
"If insulin resistance is associated with increased CVD in persons with NFG not just a more adverse risk profile demonstration that such a relationship exists will likely require a study with larger sample size and a longer period of observation.""",Salazar 2016.txt,0
The findings in this prospective population-based study of a South American population replicate results of somewhat smaller cross-sectional studies in apparently healthy populations from California that cardio-metabolic risk profile is significantly more adverse in individuals with PreDM as compared to those with NFG and that there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in degree of cardio-metabolic risk in subjects with PreDM. [16][17][18],Salazar 2016.txt,0
More importantly this study demonstrates that not only is cardio-metabolic risk increased in the IR subset of subjects with PreDM but this subset also developed significantly more CVD.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
"""There are several limitations of this study that must be acknowledged.",Salazar 2016.txt,0
First although larger than earlier reports [16][17][18] the study population was relatively modest in size numbering in the hundreds not thousands and relatively few CVD events occurred.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Furthermore the study population was almost entirely of European ancestry and contained significantly more women than men.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Another possible confounder is that oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were not performed.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
For example it is possible that subjects with a normal FPG might have had an elevated 2-h glucose value (⩾140 < 200 or ⩾200 mg/dL) and had an OGTT been performed and thus would have been mis-classified as having NFG rather than isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or T2DM respectively.,Salazar 2016.txt,1
Isolated IGT is relatively uncommon comprising <10% in populations of non-diabetic individuals of similar demographic characteristics as in this study.,Salazar 2016.txt,1
19 Consequently mis-classification of subjects with isolated IGT as NFG would be quantitatively modest and if anything make our finding that CVD events were increased in the PreDM subjects as compared to those with NFG less likely.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Furthermore data from a study in which two successive OGTTs were performed in non-diabetic individuals 48 h apart suggest that the false classification of subjects with diabetes mellitus as having PreDM is less likely to occur if the decision is based on FPG concentration as compared to values 120 min after the glucose load.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
20 Finally differentiation of IR from non-IR was somewhat arbitrary using values of FPI rather than HOMA-IR as the surrogate estimate of insulin action.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
As pointed out before this was done because results in our sample and those of a study of 758 apparently healthy non-diabetic individuals 14 demonstrated that FPI and HOMA-IR are highly correlated (r > 0.90) with in the latter study the  same relationship (r ~ 0.6) to a direct measure of insulinmediated glucose uptake.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Second FPG concentration is used in calculation of HOMA-IR and the goal of this study was to focus on the impact of insulin resistance independent of glycaemic status.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Although the concerns outlined above cannot be easily dismissed the results provide evidence that differences in insulin resistance play a central role in determining the subset of subjects with PreDM most at risk of developing CVD.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
Perhaps our findings are best viewed as a pilot study that will encourage investigators with large data bases containing ample numbers of CVD events to see whether the findings of this study can be replicated.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
If further studies support our findings fundamental pathophysiological and clinical issues need to be addressed.,Salazar 2016.txt,0
There are multiple CVD risk factors linked to insulin resistance 6 and the relative importance of each of them in the increased CVD needs exploration.,Salazar 2016.txt,0

Our study confirmed the high prevalence of impaired glucose regulation in patients with AMI.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
More importantly most abnormal glucose regulation was undiagnosed by only the FPG test but post-challenge glucometabolic abnormality was one of the most powerful predictors of long-term cardiovascular events independent of its magnitude (overt DM vs IGT) or its history (previously known vs newly diagnosed).],Tamita 2012.txt,1
[The high prevalence (72%) of impaired glucometabolic status (previous DM 31%; newly diagnosed AGT 41%) was evident in our study based on patients with AMI in the Japanese population.,Tamita 2012.txt,1
The actual prevalence might be much higher since we excluded nearly one-third of patients whose medical condition was complicated by in-hospital adverse cardiovascular events and/or renal insufficiency.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Conversely <30% of patients were categorised as having normal glucose regulation determined by the 75 g OGTT 14 days after the onset of AMI when their cardiovascular condition was fully stabilised.,Tamita 2012.txt,1

In this study 12% of individuals without overt DM (1 with NGT 8 with IGT 13 with newly diagnosed DM) were diagnosed with IFG; thus the FPG test alone identified only 10% of patients with IGT and 37% of those with newly diagnosed DM while 90% of patients with IGT and 63% of those with newly diagnosed with DM would remain undiagnosed.,Tamita 2012.txt,0

Henareh et al reported that eight patients with normal FPG had DM and 26 patients with normal FPG had IGT according to the OGTT; thus the FPG test alone identified only 39% of patients with DM and 10% of patients with IGT while 61% of patients with DM and 90% with IGT would remain undiagnosed.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
19 Elevated plasma glucose levels on admission are very common in patients with AMI and can be the first indication of glucose intolerance.,Tamita 2012.txt,1

The results of meta-analysis suggest that treatment with an insulin focus strategy only (without regard to the glucose level) does not improve mortality after AMI in the reperfusion era.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
Nevertheless it remains possible that control of hyperglycaemia by insulin infusion with a glycaemia focus improves mortality after AMI.,Tamita 2012.txt,0
27 Blood glucose should be measured at admission in all cases of AMI although this is less important if no specific treatment was then offered to restore euglycaemia where necessary.,Tamita 2012.txt,0

Our study supports the idea that racial differences in biomarkers of hyperglycemia may be the result of real differences in glycemia (rather than differences in the behavior of the biomarkers studied) perhaps due to disparities in environmental factors stress behavior diet physical activity and lifestyle factors that contribute to differences in circulating nonfasting hyperglycemia in blacks compared with whites (37).,Parrinello 2016.txt,0

"As mentioned earlier fructosamine glycated albumin and 1,5-AG are independent of the red blood cells or hemoglobin.",Parrinello 2016.txt,0
Therefore the observation that these nontraditional serum biomarkers of hyperglycemia exhibit a pattern of racial differences similar to that of HbA 1c provides evidence that nonglycemic factors such as hemoglobin glycation or red cell turnover may not explain observed racial disparities in the overall population (38).,Parrinello 2016.txt,0

Age at diabetes diagnosis was not collected at the first or second ARIC examinations and we therefore were unable to account for potential racial differences in duration of diabetes.,Parrinello 2016.txt,0
However among participants who had ever reported a diagnosis of diabetes at visit 2 (the baseline examination for this study) 31% (33% of blacks and 30% of whites) did not report diabetes at visit 1 3 years earlier and could be considered to have new-onset diabetes.,Parrinello 2016.txt,1
We also cannot rule out the possibility that differences in levels of biomarkers of hyperglycemia by race may be the result of cultural differences by geography rather than race alone.,Parrinello 2016.txt,0
In the ARIC Study black participants were recruited almost exclusively from two of the four field centers (Jackson Mississippi and Forsyth County North Carolina).,Parrinello 2016.txt,0
Although this was one of the largest studies to address this research question it is possible that we may have been underpowered to detect moderate but statistically significant differences in the associations of biomarkers with outcomes in whites versus blacks.,Parrinello 2016.txt,0

Although the response rates of the K-NHANES were not 100% and some of samples (i.e. those with invalid personal identification numbers or missing data pregnant women those with ischaemic heart disease diabetes or cancer at baseline) were excluded our study subjects include Korean men and women with various socio-demographic characteristics all over the country.,Khang_2010.txt,0
Compared to Western countries the proportion of people with diabetes has dramatically increased throughout Asia.,Kim 2014.txt,0
People in Asia tend to develop diabetes with a lesser degree of obesity at a younger age suffer more from complications of diabetes and die sooner than people in other regions [24].,Kim 2014.txt,0
This is the first Korean population-based study to show that diabetes as determined using an OGTT is associated with increased all cause and cancer mortality.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for all-cause mortality.,Kim 2014.txt,1
"An increasing number of epidemiologic studies have found that diabetes may alter the risk of developing a variety of cancers [3] and that diabetes is associated with death from cancer [5,6].",Kim 2014.txt,0
In agreement with previous publications this study found that the HR for cancer death was more than 2-fold higher in subjects with diabetes defined by FPG or 2hPG after adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity which is a confounding factor of cancer mortality.,Kim 2014.txt,1
This risk is even higher than the risk reported by the Korean Cancer Prevention Study (KCPS) [4].,Kim 2014.txt,0
The KCPS reported HRs for cancer death of 1.29 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.37) in men and 1.23 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.39) in women with an FPG ≥7.8 mmol/L compared to subjects with an FPG <5 mmol/L.,Kim 2014.txt,1
However the KCPS did not show the impact of postload hyperglycemia on cancer death.,Kim 2014.txt,0
The exact mechanism of increased risk for cancer death in individuals with diabetes is not clear.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia has been known to promote carcinogenesis since insulin is an important growth factor for cancer cells [25].,Kim 2014.txt,1
In recent epidemiologic studies insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer [26] and higher blood IGF-1 levels were observed in prostate and breast cancer [27].,Kim 2014.txt,0
Direct effects of hyperglycemia via increased oxidative stress and accumulating advanced glycation end-products may play a role in the development of cancer [28].,Kim 2014.txt,0
Diabetes may also affect the treatment of cancer as some types of cancer are treated less aggressively in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes [29].,Kim 2014.txt,0
Furthermore certain glucose-lowering medications may modify the risk and prognosis of cancer [30].,Kim 2014.txt,0
There have been inconsistencies in the prognostic implication of fasting and postload hyperglycemia.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Subjects with IFG had a greater impairment in early phase insulin secretion and increased endogenous glucose output whereas IGT was associated with peripheral insulin resistance.,Kim 2014.txt,0
"In the Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE) study 2hPG was a stronger risk factor for death than FPG [10]; however two other studies showed that neither IFG nor IGT increased the risk for all-cause mortality [11,12].",Kim 2014.txt,1
The present study also suggested that hyperglycemia according to FPG or 2hPG criteria had a similar risk of death not only in subjects with diabetic glucose ranges but also in those with nondiabetic glucose ranges.,Kim 2014.txt,1
However the prognostic implication of lowering the IFG cutoff point from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/L as proposed in 2003 by the ADA remains controversial Recently Kim et al. [18] showed that stage 2 IFG was associated with future risk of CVD after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors whereas stage 1 IFG was not.,Kim 2014.txt,1
In accordance with their study the present finding that subjects with prediabetes defined as stage 2 IFG and/or IGT had a higher risk for all cause death suggests that stage 1 and 2 IFG have different prognoses.,Kim 2014.txt,1
This difference may be attributed to the higher metabolic risk in subjects with stage 2 IFG than in subjects with NFG as shown in a baseline study of this population [19].,Kim 2014.txt,0
The present study also demonstrated that cancer death did not significantly increase in subjects with stage 2 IFG (HR 1.54; 95% CI 0.88 to 2.68) or IGT (HR 1.43; 95% CI 0.88 to 2.35) when compared to subjects with NGR II.,Kim 2014.txt,0
The association of cancer mortality and IFG and/or IGT is not yet clear.,Kim 2014.txt,0
In the NHANES II IGT was a strong risk factor for cancer mortality (HR 1.87; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.31) and in a pooled analysis of three longitudinal studies in Mauritius Fiji and Nauru the HR for cancer death was 8.0 in men with isolated postload hyperglycemia compared to those with NGR (95% CI 3.6 to 17.9) [13].,Kim 2014.txt,1
"However two other studies showed that IGT was not associated with increased cancer death whereas diabetes was [6,14].",Kim 2014.txt,0
"In the DECODE study [15] which included 44,655 subjects from a number of European population-based studies the HR for cancer mortality was 1.13 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.28) in men and 1.11 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.3) in women with IFG and/ or IGT compared to those with NGR.",Kim 2014.txt,0
Although there are some inconsistencies these studies demonstrate the importance of both FPG and 2hPG in predicting fatal cancer even in subjects without diabetes.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for CVD; however we could not find any relation between death from CVD and diabetes by either FPG or 2hPG criteria.,Kim 2014.txt,1
Only subjects with a long duration of diabetes had a high risk of CVD death in a study involving Pima Indians [12].,Kim 2014.txt,0
Thus the fact that there was no association between diabetes and CVD death in the present study could be attributed to the short duration of diabetes in the study participants.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Other explanations include a limited number of CVD deaths and potential inaccuracies in the causes of death as reported on the death certificate.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Compared to deaths from CVD cancer mortality can be proven more accurately due to the National Cancer Registration Program.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Another limitation of this study is the heterogeneity of the three cohort studies used in this pooled analysis.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Different ages and lifestyles which are often found in different residential areas may be important confounding factors.,Kim 2014.txt,0
However this study adjusted for age study center and other risk factors associated with mortality in the regression model to minimize the heterogeneity issue.,Kim 2014.txt,0
Nevertheless this is the first population-based Korean study to evaluate mortality risk according to discrete glucose tolerance categories as defined by a glucose tolerance test.,Kim 2014.txt,1
In conclusion diabetes is a significant risk factor for both all cause and cancer mortality independent of obesity.,Kim 2014.txt,0

In this CAD cohort elevated fasting rather than postprandial (postmeal) glucose levels were predictive of future all-cause and CV mortality.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Impaired FPG was associated with a risk of death and major CV events intermediate between normoglycemic and diabetic subjects.,Nigam 2007.txt,1
As expected diabetic patients based on FPG levels possessed highest risk of fatal or nonfatal outcomes in this cohort.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
To our knowledge the present study was the first to examine the potential prognostic significance of 2hPG levels measured following an average meal.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
2hPG measurements after a standardized meal have been shown to correlate with 2 h postchallenge glucose levels measured after an OGTT (21)(22)(23).,Nigam 2007.txt,0
In addition IGT as diagnosed during an OGTT is a known risk factor for long-term mortality as noted previously (11)(12)(13).,Nigam 2007.txt,1
Despite this fact no study has yet evaluated whether elevated postprandial blood glucose levels measured after an average meal are also predictive of future fatal events.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
From our analyses PPH was not associated with a significant risk of fatal or nonfatal outcomes in patients with FPG levels of lower than 6.1 mmol/L.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Similarly diabetic patients based on 2hPG levels did not possess a higher risk of death in multivariate models.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
In contrast increasing levels of FPG were predictive of an increased risk of nonfatal and fatal events after controlling for 2hPG levels.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
The prevalence of CAD disease risk factors has been shown to be higher in individuals with IFG than in persons with normal FPG levels (20).,Nigam 2007.txt,0
"In the Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Europe (DECODE) study ( 16) comprising 25,364 persons in 13 prospective European cohorts followed on average for 7.3 years IFG was associated with a 1.2-fold higher risk of all-cause death in individuals without known CAD in univariate analyses although the risk of death was not significantly higher in multivariate models.",Nigam 2007.txt,1
IFG has been shown to be associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality in patients with documented CAD (17).,Nigam 2007.txt,1
In the DECODE study the presence of IGT following a 75 g glucose challenge was associated with a higher risk of death than IFG (16).,Nigam 2007.txt,1
In addition IGT was shown to be an independent predictor of CV mortality in patients with normal FPG levels whereas IFG was not associated with any significant CV risk after controlling for 2hPG levels (15).,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Recent data (24) have also indicated that treatment of IGT with acarbose to reduce PPH significantly reduces CV events and the development of hypertension.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Similarly reduction of peak PPH with the insulin secretagogue ripaglinide has been shown to reduce carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes (25).,Nigam 2007.txt,0
These data suggest that postprandial glucose may be a stronger risk factor than FPG in certain populations.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Our data from the CASS registry indicate that IFG was a stronger risk factor for all-cause and CV disease mortality than PPH in patients with CAD.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
While PPH was a predictor of death in univariate analyses its impact on outcomes was negligible in the presence of normal FPG levels of less than 6.1 mmol/L.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Similarly when analyzed as a continuous variable 2hPG was not predictive of increased morbidity and mortality after adjusting for FPG.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
In contrast FPG was predictive of future nonfatal and fatal clinical events even after adjusting for postprandial plasma glucose.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Several potential hypotheses may explain why our results differed from those of epidemiological studies in patients without CAD.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
First the measurement of 2hPG levels was not standardized in the CASS registry and might have varied considerably due to the type and quantity of food consumed as well as geographical factors given that this study was undertaken across North America.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Second 2hPG levels may not reflect glucose metabolism occurring after a standard 75 g OGTT and may therefore not be associated with the same CV risk.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Third patients with IFG had a slightly higher body mass index as well as higher levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides than patients with PPH and were similar to diabetic subjects.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Although we did adjust for available confounders in our multivariate models other confounding factors might have continued to affect CV and non-CV risk in our cohort.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Fourth IFG is perhaps a stronger CV risk factor relative to IGT in individuals without other components of the metabolic syndrome.,Nigam 2007.txt,1
Patients with PPH had a mean body mass index of 25.9 kg/m 2 and a median triglyceride level of 1.94 mmol/L only slightly higher than the cut-off of 1.7 mmol/L used for the  the metabolic syndrome.,Nigam 2007.txt,1
Therefore patients with PPH in the CASS registry were less likely to have possessed insulin resistance and its pathophysiological consequences which are often associated with CV risk.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Postprandial hyperinsulinemia appears to be a more significant determinant of CAD than postprandial glycemia in patients with the metabolic syndrome according to one recent study (26).,Nigam 2007.txt,0
In addition the small sample size may also explain why neither PPH nor diabetes based on a postprandial glucose level of 11.1 mmol/L or higher were associated with a significant risk of clinical events in our multivariate models because we did note a significant trend of increasing mortality with increasing levels of postprandial glucose in unadjusted models.,Nigam 2007.txt,1
Finally given that this study involved a coronary population with a relatively high risk of recurrent events the ability to differentiate risk based on glycemic status might have been lower than in a noncoronary population.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
"Our data are consistent with two other studies performed in CAD patients (17,27).",Nigam 2007.txt,0
"Among 11,853 patients with a previous myocardial infarction who were followed on average for 7.7 years IFG was associated with a 1.4-fold increased risk of all-cause death and a 1.3-fold increased risk of CAD death (17).",Nigam 2007.txt,1
In 1612 patients with CAD who were undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention IFG was associated with a threefold higher risk of death compared with patients with normal fasting glycemia after a mean follow-up of 2.8 years (27).,Nigam 2007.txt,1
In contrast Arcavi et al (28) failed to demonstrate a significant association between IFG and mortality in 293 survivors of myocardial infarction with IFG presumably due to the small sample size.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
We extend current knowledge by demonstrating that IFG confers a higher long-term risk (median follow-up 14.7 years) of death in CAD patients.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
In addition IFG remained an independent predictor of clinical events in multivariate models even after adjusting for 2hPG.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Thus IFG alone is capable of exerting a significant negative effect on outcomes in a CAD population presumably through multiple mechanisms including impaired endothelial function (29) oxidative stress (30) and inflammation (31).,Nigam 2007.txt,0
"""CASS was performed during the 1970s and 1980s and the outcomes we measured necessarily reflect the treatment practices at the time the original study was undertaken.",Nigam 2007.txt,0
Approximately onequarter of patients in CASS were women.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
While one may question whether our results are applicable to women the CASS cohort contained a higher percentage of women than a previous study (17) that obtained similar results.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Third a single blood specimen performed at study entry was used to define each patients glycemic status.,Nigam 2007.txt,0
Finally we did not use the new American Diabetes Association (32) definition for IFG of 5.6 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L; however when analyzed as continuous variables both fasting and postprandial glucose level behaved in ways similar to those reported here.,Nigam 2007.txt,1
"""",Nigam 2007.txt,0
We found that the risk of mortality in men aged ≥75 years was significantly higher than that in older men aged <75 years.,Fang_2019.txt,0
The goal of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that IFG is an independent risk factor for CV events in a population-based sample of adults free of CVD at baseline.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
After 7.5 years of follow-up of the largest multi-ethnic cohort so far studied on this subject we observed that: 1) the threshold of fasting blood glucose that is independently associated with CV risk may be in the DM range; 2) IFG is an independent risk factor for future T2DM; and 3) IFG is not an independent CV risk factor.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Since T2DM is an independent CV risk factor aggressive lifestyle modifications that reduce the incidence of T2DM in persons with IFG may have significant impact on CV events rates in this population.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
1. Even though current theory supports the association between IFG and incident CV events the data are mixed (5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15).,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Coutinho et al. (10) showed in a meta-analysis of 20 studies that the progressive relationship between glucose levels and CV risk extends below the diabetic threshold.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Kim et al. (9) showed in a cross-sectional study that IFG may not be associated with increased CV risk in community-based subjects.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Tominaga et al. (12) used a Japanese population to show that impaired glucose tolerance was a risk factor for CVD but IFG was not a risk factor for CVD.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Pankow et al. (11) showed in the ARIC study that in addition to the poor agreement between IFG and post-challenge glucose levels neither fasting glucose nor impaired glucose tolerance was associated with adverse CV risk profile.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Kanaya et al. (7) also showed that IFG is not independently associated with increased risk of CV events in post-menopausal women with coronary artery disease.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
However Levitzky et al. (8) used the Framingham Offspring Study participants to show that IFG may be an independent CV risk factor in women but not in men.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Sawar et al. (13) added a systematic review of Western cohorts to the Reykjavik prospective study to show a modest CV risk among Caucasians with IFG.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The findings of this study (13) were also limited by the incomplete adjustment for confounders in these studies and the use of ICD-9 codes in the ascertainment of outcomes.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Ford et al. ( 14) also showed a modest increase CV risk in their meta-analyses on the association of IFG and CV outcomes.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
However those researchers admitted in their conclusions that depending on the set of studies included in their meta-analysis their findings could be interpreted as no increase or at most a very modest increase in CV risk (14).,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The present study adds to the data suggesting that while IFG is a risk factor for T2DM and DM is an independent CV risk factor IFG per se is not an independent CV risk factor at least during a relatively short time-frame.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The concept of IFG defined as fasting blood glucose between 110 and 125 mg/dl was recommended by the American Diabetes Association Expert Committee in 1997 as a risk category for further screening using a more definitive test such as a 2-h post-challenge glucose test in subjects at risk of developing T2DM (19).,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Data from population studies suggested that a fasting blood glucose range of 94 to 103 mg/dl predicted persons in whom T2DM would develop (20).,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
On the basis of these population-based studies and in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of IFG as a screening tool the fasting glucose criterion was lowered in 2003 by the American Diabetes Association to 100 to 125 mg/dl.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
The implication of the lowering of the fasting glucose criterion was an almost quadrupling of the number of Americans with IFG from 12 million to 44 million (1).,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
The present study found IFG as an independent risk factor for the development of T2DM supporting the notion that interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of IFG would ultimately result in a reduction in the incidence of T2DM in the population.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Diabetes mellitus is considered a coronary heart disease equivalent (11) and persons with IFG (pre-diabetes) have an increased risk of T2DM developing.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
Supported by a meta-regression analysis (10) IFG was postulated to be an independent CV risk factor and this has been adopted by the American Diabetes Association.,Yeboah 2011.txt,1
In the present study the significant association of IFG and CV events in our univariate model was explained by traditional CV risk factors suggesting that the proposed increased CV risk may be due to the coexistence of traditional CV risk factors in persons with IFG.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The subset of IFG subjects in whom T2DM developed during the follow-up period had similar risk for CV events compared with subjects with IFG who did not have T2DM during the follow-up period.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The subjects with IFG in whom T2DM developed during follow-up were younger more likely to be female and obese.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Thus DM was more likely to develop in young obese females with IFG in this cohort and they would therefore be at relatively high risk of future CV events.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
This finding needs replication in other cohorts but has major public health implications with regard to target blood pressure and lipid goals and cost and allocation of resources for the prevention and treatment of CV diseases.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
More studies aimed at identifying the subset of subjects with IFG in whom T2DM would develop and who are therefore at risk of CV events are needed.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Study limitations.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The follow-up period was only 7.5 years.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
We considered defining IFG and DM using a time-dependent variable approach (updating the status at each examination); however we had insufficient incident CV events/limited follow-up time post-transition to produce meaningful results.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Therefore we caution readers to interpret the results of this study within the context of the duration of follow-up.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
It is unclear but possible that given the strong association between IFG and incident T2DM a longer duration of follow-up may reveal a positive association between IFG and CVD events.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The sample size of the subjects with IFG was modest.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Our investigation of incident in the IFG subgroup was limited by the relatively short follow-up time for incident CV after conversion to T2DM.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The participants with T2DM had DM for a variable period before enrollment in the MESA study; thus a comparison of the risk of CV in this group versus IFG or new T2DM is perhaps not a fair comparison to make.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Our study is observational and although we adjusted for the known confounders in our models our results may still be affected by residual confounding.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
Finally we used a population-based cohort free of clinical CVD at baseline and our findings do not apply to populations with clinical CVD who are at risk for recurrent CVD.],Yeboah 2011.txt,0
[After 7.5 years of follow-up simply having IFG was not associated with an increased risk for incident CV events.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
More studies aimed at identifying persons with IFG in whom T2DM would develop and who are therefore at increased risk of CV events are needed.,Yeboah 2011.txt,0
The main findings of the present analysis of the PROSPECT study are that: 1) the prevalence of DM and pre-DM is high among patients admitted for ACS when ADA criteria are applied; and 2) DM but not pre-DM was an independent predictor of MACEs although patients with neither DM nor pre-DM had more severe CAD than patients with NGM as detected by indexes of plaque morphology.],Farhan 2019.txt,0
[CAD have been less effective in patients with versus without DM (13).,Farhan 2019.txt,0

In the present study the risk for MACEs was approximately double for patients with versus without DM a finding that is consistent with previous studies showing that the risk for adverse events after PCI is approximately double for patients with DM versus without DM (14).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
In contrast the risk for patients with pre-DM was similar to that of patients with NGM.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
This may seem surprising but it is consistent,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Thus compared with patients with DM in other studies patients with DM in PROSEPCT likely had less severe and less long-standing hyperglycemia at the time of coronary assessment (9).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
We prospectively  studied nonculprit lesions after successful PCI whereas the other studies focused on culprit lesions.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
"It is possible that the association between DM and highrisk plaque characteristics that has been described for culprit lesions is less pronounced in nonculprit lesions (25,26).",Farhan 2019.txt,1
Notably only the proximal 6 to 8 cm of each major epicardial coronary artery was evaluated in the PROSPECT study (7).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Necropsy studies have shown that DM affects predominantly distal portions of coronary arteries (27) which could explain the apparent lack of differences in high-risk plaque features.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Microvascular dysfunction which is prevalent among patients with DM may have contributed to the increased risk for MACE among patients with DM (28).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Last the diagnostic criteria used to detect pre-DM and latent DM were different in our study than in the other studies (29).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
It is possible that stratification of patients into NGM pre-DM and DM groups as per the ADA guidelines is not the most efficient means of predicting the presence of high-risk plaque characteristics.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
In fact a previous publication from PROSPECT that focused on established DM and metabolic syndrome rather than pre-DM showed that patients with neither DM nor metabolic syndrome had the most favorable plaque characteristics although these differences were small in magnitude (30).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
The differences between the present analysis and that of Marso et al.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Given the fact that most patients in the DM group had non-insulin-dependent DM our findings are consistent with previous observations that primary preventive measures appear to be more effective in patients with non-insulin-dependent versus insulindependent DM (31).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
"Thus even among patients who have progressed to non-insulin-treated DM appropriate glucometabolic control and other therapeutic measures may prevent progression of CAD (32,33).",Farhan 2019.txt,0
This hypothesis should be tested in clinical trials specifically designed for patients with pre-DM or newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent DM. STUDY LIMITATIONS.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
This study had several limitations.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
First this was a post hoc analysis of a prospective study and our results should be considered hypothesis generating rather than confirmatory.,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Second plasma glucose concentrations may be increased in ACS which increases the risk of inadvertently classifying patients with NGM as having pre-DM or DM (34); however the GAMI (Glucose Tolerance in Acute Myocardial Infarction) study which enrolled patients with acute myocardial infarction showed that results were similar when glucose tolerance was estimated during the index hospitalization or 3 months later (35).,Farhan 2019.txt,0
Moreover these studies have varied with respect to characteristics of the baseline population number of deaths and statistical analyses.,Wang_2007.txt,0
Since one of main purpose of the working definitions for the MetS has been to establish a useful clinical tool to identify individuals at high risk for CVD it is important to investigate whether the current six definitions for the Met predict CVD morbidity and mortality and compare their ability to predict mortality in one study population as we have done in the present study.,Wang_2007.txt,1
Second our study has a large number of deaths (445 deaths) due to a long which ensures an adequate power of statistical analyses.,Wang_2007.txt,0
These results support those of Skriver et al. who found increased all-cause mortality among those with an HbA1 C measurement 7% (53 mmol/mol) (HR 1.26 (95% CI 1.15 1.39)) and a U-shaped relationship between increasing HbA1 C all-cause mortality.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Research able to utilise larger datasets with a greater number of cancer mortality endpoints is needed to further assess the association between HbA1 C and cancer mortality.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Although limited in number previous studies have suggested that increased blood glucose is associated with increased mortality from a number of site-specific cancers but is not associated with Therefore results related to a grouped all-cancers variable may be concealing differences in site-specific cancer mortality risk.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
Although the epidemiological evidence related to HbA1 C and cancer is limited the key biological causal factors relate to the anti-apoptotic proliferative and nature of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and the impact that hyperglycaemia has upon mortality risk.,Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
"At the same time the potential deleterious impact of tighter control-for example the increased mortality found within the strict glucose control group of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study and the risk of hypoglycaemia [9,[38][39][40]-would have to be balanced against any such reductions in mortality and take into account the specific characteristics of each individual with raised blood glucose.",Gordon-Dseagu_2015.txt,0
In this large prospective community-based cohort study of Korean adults we found that prediabetes defined by IGT or HbA1 C was significantly associated with the development of CKD independent of traditional CKD risk factors.,Kim 2019.txt,1
However the incidence and relative risk for CKD was not associated with IFG.,Kim 2019.txt,0
To the best of our knowledge this is the first and largest population-based prospective study to evaluate the association between prediabetes as assessed by IGT HbA1 C  and IFG and the development of CKD.,Kim 2019.txt,1
In addition older age (> 65 years) BMI hypertension and metabolic syndrome were revealed as risk factors for CKD in our community-based cohort.,Kim 2019.txt,1
These results were in line with previous studies.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Older age [9] obesity [10] hypertension [11] and metabolic syndrome [12] are well-recognized risk factors for developing CKD.,Kim 2019.txt,1
"Other risk factors including dyslipidemia and hypertension are also associated with the development of CKD in patients with diabetes [13,14].",Kim 2019.txt,0
Male gender was associated with an increased risk of CKD in our study.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Previous studies showed the prevalence of CKD is higher in women than in men including US renal data system (USRDS) annual data report [15][16][17].,Kim 2019.txt,0
However there were also opposing data regarding this issue [18][19][20].,Kim 2019.txt,0
Korea data also showed female gender was associated with less reduced renal function (Odds ratio 0.874 95% CI 0.766-.0.997) and trend toward lower incidence of CKD (Odds ratio 0.953 95% CI 0.848-1.071) [21].,Kim 2019.txt,0
Thus we think that there might be a geographic variability in the effect of gender on the prevalence of CKD.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Several studies have shown that prediabetes and metabolic syndrome are associated with CKD development after adjustment for established CKD risk factors [22][23][24][25][26].,Kim 2019.txt,1
In one meta-analysis that included 9 cohort studies (8 IFG-defined prediabetes and 1 HbA 1C -defined prediabetes study) showed that the overall relative risk of CKD was 1.12 (95% CI. 1.02-1.21) after adjustments for established risk factors [7].,Kim 2019.txt,0
However most of the studies defined prediabetes according to IFG since IGT determination requires 2-h post-glucose measurement.,Kim 2019.txt,1
Our study is different from earlier studies that reported an association between prediabetes and CKD because we used three different definitions of prediabetes.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Interestingly there was no difference in baseline fasting glucose level or the incidence of IFG according to the presence of overt CKD in our subjects.,Kim 2019.txt,0
In contrast baseline IGT-or HbA1 C -defined prediabetes was more prevalent in the CKD group and the hazard ratio was also robustly higher after adjusting for traditional CKD risk factors.,Kim 2019.txt,1
It is difficult to know exactly whether this is an incidental finding or a meaningful difference.,Kim 2019.txt,0
In previous studies only one definition was studied or both IGT and IFG were included in the definition of prediabetes [26].,Kim 2019.txt,1
Although both IGT and IFG are included in prediabetes the clinical impact or underlying mechanism might be different.,Kim 2019.txt,1
We think IGT or HbA1 C level may better reflect long-term exposure to non-diabetic hyperglycemia than IFG.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Previous study reported that IFG reflects defects in insulin secretion and IGT reflects insulin resistance [27].,Kim 2019.txt,1
Milicevic et al. [28] reported that IGT and HbA1 C were more strongly associated with cardiovascular outcomes than IFG was.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Therefore clinical significance of each indicator is expected to be studied in the future.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Previous researchers suggested some potential mechanisms by which prediabetes might affect the initiation and progression of CKD.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Individuals with prediabetes can be as insulin-resistant as individuals with diabetes.,Kim 2019.txt,0
"Thus dysfunction in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates and loss of protein stores which are often  observed in patients with insulin-resistance may be associated with kidney damage in prediabetic individuals [29,30].",Kim 2019.txt,0
"Cross-sectional studies have revealed that borderline hyperglycemia or prehypertension is associated with glomerular hyperfiltration which is a marker of early renal damage [31,32].",Kim 2019.txt,1
Thus in subjects with prediabetes or prehypertension especially with comorbid glomerular hyperfiltration earlier treatment of hyperglycemia or high blood pressure may be necessary to prevent the development of kidney damage.,Kim 2019.txt,0
"In addition insulin resistance may lead to CKD by alteration of endothelial function and inflammation sodium retention and activation of the sympathetic nervous system [33,34].",Kim 2019.txt,0
The present study has several advantages over previous studies.,Kim 2019.txt,0
As mentioned above we examined all the three commonly used prediabetes definition parameters (IFG IGT and HbA1 C ) to identify their relationship with CKD.,Kim 2019.txt,1
Second this study prospectively followed a relatively large number of subjects for an average of 9 years.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Development of incidental CKD is preceded by glomerular hyperfiltration which is an important link between prediabetes and CKD development.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Thus short or intermediate follow-up periods might not capture the association between prediabetes and CKD.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Moreover although most of the published studies have relied on GFR estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equation [7] we defined CKD using the CKD-EPI equation which performs better than the MDRD equation especially at higher GFR with less bias and greater accuracy [35].,Kim 2019.txt,1
Because most individuals with prediabetes have higher GFR the CKD-EPI equation might better reflect kidney function.,Kim 2019.txt,0
This study has several limitations.,Kim 2019.txt,0
First GFR was not measured directly but was estimated using a serum creatinine-based equation which might have overestimated or underestimated the actual GFR.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Second we did not have information on urine analysis including microalbuminuria a known risk factor for the development of kidney disease in individuals with diabetes.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Considering CKD is defined by the presence of albuminuria as well as by eGFR overall CKD may be underestimated in this study.,Kim 2019.txt,1
Third because all participants were required to attend follow-up examination those who died or developed serious comorbidities were excluded; thus we may have introduced survival bias.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Fourth this study was restricted to only Koreans.,Kim 2019.txt,0
Therefore these results might not be applicable to other ethnic groups.,Kim 2019.txt,0
We found that history of diabetes and newly detected diabetes was associated with a markedly increased long-term mortality amongst survivors of a first AMI.,Janszky 2009.txt,1
We also observed a trend towards increased mortality amongst IFG patients when compared to patients with normal glucose levels.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Similar patterns were seen for other outcomes than death especially for new AMI and hospitalization for heart failure.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Compelling evidence suggests that diabetes is a strong adverse prognostic factor after an AMI [3][4][5][6]25].,Janszky 2009.txt,1
As overviewed by Capes et al. [7] and confirmed by more recent studies [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] elevated admission and ⁄ or fasting glucose levels measured in the early phase of AMI i.e. within a few days after the admission also seem to predict poor prognosis even in nondiabetic patients.,Janszky 2009.txt,1
However the role of hyperglycemia in the early phase is a complex issue.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
"Acute stress because of the MI may raise blood glucose levels but higher stress is also accompanied with higher cathecolamine levels which could impair endothelial function myocardial metabolism or coagulation [12,26].",Janszky 2009.txt,0
"Hyperglycemic patients during the acute phase of AMI may have higher free fatty acid concentrations which together with hyperglycemia itself can have deleterious effects on the myocardium [27,28].",Janszky 2009.txt,0
It is also possible that higher glucose level in the acute phase is simply a marker of the severity of myocardial damage [7].,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Therefore it is not possible to generalize the results on admission glucose or fasting glucose measured a few days after the onset to a metabolically more stable phase.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
To the best of knowledge the present study is the first to investigate directly the prognostic role of IFG evaluated in a stable phase i.e. 3 months after an AMI.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
The role of impaired glucose metabolism was evaluated in other stable nondiabetic CHD populations.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Lenzen et al. [29] could not identify impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance without diabetes as an adverse prognostic factor in patients admit-ted to cardiology outpatient clinics with coronary artery disease.,Janszky 2009.txt,1
In contrast Fisman et al. [30] demonstrated that fasting glucose is a strong predictor of mortality amongst nondiabetic patients with a history of myocardial infarction or with a documented coronary heart disease.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Arcavi et al. [31] also concluded that IFG predicts adverse outcomes in patients with an established coronary artery disease.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Similarly Port et al. [32] investigated nondiabetic participants from the Framingham Heart Study who reported CHD stroke congestive heart failure or intermittent claudication and found a steep increase in risk associated with glucose level through the whole range with no indication of a threshold.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
"Moreover IFG seems to be a predictor of outcome in CHD patients undergoing revascularization procedures [33,34].",Janszky 2009.txt,0
Generally we found a weaker adverse effect of IFG than the earlier studies.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
However direct comparison of the results of the present and that of the earlier studies is difficult.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
We investigated uniquely a stable metabolic phase of an AMI and we also used a lower cut off value of fasting glucose concentration to define IFG than the majority of earlier studies.,Janszky 2009.txt,1
In our alternative analyses we found no indication that the level of glucose between 6.1 and 7 mmol L )1 would be a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes than that of between 5.6 and 6.1 mmol L )1 .,Janszky 2009.txt,1
Therefore our findings provided some further support for the current ADA definition of using the lower threshold [19].,Janszky 2009.txt,1
This is in contrast to the findings of Verges et al. [11] who similarly to us divided the IFG category to fasting glucose levels between 5.6-6.1 mmol L )1 and 6.1-7 mmol L )1 .,Janszky 2009.txt,1
The authors concluded that only the latter one was associated with increased risk for shortterm mortality after AMI.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Previous results are conflicting whether patients with newly detected or those with known diabetes are at a greater risk.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
"According to some studies [8,12] admission plasma glucose above 11 mmol L )1 is more dangerous if newly detected compared to old diabetes.",Janszky 2009.txt,1
On the other hand Lenzen et al. [29] found that CHD patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had lower mortality than patients with known diabetes.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
In the present study history of diabetes mellitus and newly detected diabetes had a similar association to total mortality.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Associations with cardiac mortality new AMI and hospitalization for heart failure were stronger amongst patients with a history of diabetes.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
We found that both fasting insulin and HOMA were associated to adverse outcomes.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
This was especially true for heart failure and cardiac mortality.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
However when we restricted our analyses to patients without old or newly detected diabetes these associations weakened substantially.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Few studies reported on the association between insulin or insulin resistance and AMI prognosis.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Kragelund et al. [35] concluded that fasting insulin predicts mortality in nondiabetic AMI patients.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Stubbs et al. [36] found that the insulin resistance is an important predictive measure of poor outcome in AMI patients without diabetes and is superior to admission glucose.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
It should be mentioned that these studies were performed a few days after the event and insulin levels are also known to be affected by the metabolic disturbances in the acute phase [28].,Janszky 2009.txt,0
There several potential routes by which hyperglycemia increased insulin and insulin resistance may impact upon the cardiovascular system.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
"These include glucosylation of LDL and clotting factors [2] increased oxidative stress and mimicking the proinflammatory effects of citokines [1,[37][38][39] decreased fibrinolysis [40] or elevation in inflammatory markers [41].",Janszky 2009.txt,0
It is not clear from our results whether hyperglycemia below the diabetic threshold has adverse effects itself or it is merely a predictor of future diabetes [2].],Janszky 2009.txt,1
[Potential limitations of our study need to be considered.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
We relied on fasting glucose levels and did not perform an oral glucose tolerance test.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Although this is in accordance with the current ADA recommendations [19],Janszky 2009.txt,0
Bartnik et al. [9] found that oral glucose tolerance test is a superior predictor of adverse events after AMI than fasting glucose.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
The point estimates associated with IFG in our analyses suggest a 30-40% excess risk for both cardiac and total mortality.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
This would imply a biologically and clinically relevant effect.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
We included more patients than most previous studies still our statistical power to detect an association between outcome and IFG was limited.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
This is reflected in the wide confidence intervals.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Further studies are warranted to determine the prognostic importance of IFG evaluated in a stable phase after an AMI.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
The low sample size for patients with newly detected diabetes is also a limitation of the present study.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Observational studies inherently limit causal inference.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Although we adjusted for several potential confounders in our multivariable analyses we were not able to assure that all potential confounding is controlled for.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
However any remaining confounder potentially able to influence our results considerably would need to be strongly associated with glucometabolic status and prognosis of AMI and generally unrelated to the factors included in our models.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
To document adverse outcomes during the follow up we relied on national Swedish registries that have been validated but are nonetheless prone to misclassification.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
This -supposedly random -misclassification may partly explain the weak associations with stroke.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
It should also be emphasized that there were only few cases of stroke amongst subjects with a history of diabetes resulting in wide confidence intervals for hazard ratios.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Because of the relatively small number of cases it was not meaningful to distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.,Janszky 2009.txt,0
Cardiovascular disease is the single most common cause of death among patients with T2DM.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
An increased risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality is observed among patients with MI and hyperglycemia even below the diabetic threshold.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
"20,21",Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
In our study patients with ACS and kT2DM or nT2DM had a significantly increased risk of death or MI and MACE compared with patients with NGM after approximately three years of follow-up while increased risk was not found in patients with newly detected prediabetes.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
"Previous studies on dysglycemia in patients with CAD have consistently shown an increased risk of future adverse events among patients with prediabetes nT2DM and kT2DM during 3-10 years of follow-up. 8,[22][23][24][25]",Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
However all of these studies have relied on one single OGTT to classify patients into different glucometabolic groups.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
As previously shown by our group and others the diagnostic accuracy of a single OGTT is less than optimal and not according to current ADA and WHO guidelines.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
14,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
The main findings of these previous studies have been to identify an increased risk of composite MACE rather than a more robust end point of death/MI used in our study.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Also most of these studies were retrospective analyses performed on registry patients who accordingly were not treated in a uniform manner according to current ACS guidelines and many of them did not receive lifestyle treatment for glucometabolic derangements.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
The current study was a prospective follow-up study where patients diagnosed with metabolic derangements were treated according to current guideline recommendations with lifestyle intervention and pharmacologic therapy when clinically indicated all of which are known to affect long-term prognosis favorably.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Also in contrast to some of the previous ones the current study was done in the modern era of dual antiplatelet therapy in ACS with a high proportion of patients treated invasively.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
The majority of ST-elevation MI patients (92%) were treated with urgent revascularization (primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (87%) or urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (4.7%)) and an invasive approach was used in 76% of non-ST-elevation MI patients (PCI 60% and CABG 16%).,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Moreover a more robust method was used to diagnose prediabetes and nT2DM where at least two measurements above the diabetic cut off value was required to diagnose nT2DM.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
This method identified a true high-risk subgroup which is reflected in higher hazard ratios for all cause death or MI and MACE in the current study than have been found in previous ones on this patient group.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
The information that  our study adds to the current knowledge is that after almost three years of follow-up patients with ACS and T2DM whether known or newly detected are at significantly increased risk of death or MI and MACE in spite of optimal medical treatment.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Unsurprisingly patients with kT2DM had higher hazard ratio for death or MI and MACE compared with nT2DM in our study.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Even though the duration of T2DM was not evaluated it would be expected to involve a longer exposure of the risk factor among patients with kT2DM attributing to higher morbidity compared with patients with nT2DM.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
This is reflected in a long-term follow-up of patients with acute MI that demonstrated increased mortality among patients with T2DM compared with patients with NGM 20 years following the MI. 25,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
These results show that metabolic derangements prediabetes and diabetes are present in the majority of ACS patients and they cause an increased risk of significant clinical events in the nearest future.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,1
However active lifestyle and/or pharmacological intervention will improve the prognosis of these patients.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
For patients with prediabetes lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss with low caloric diet and physical exercise has shown to reduce the risk of developing T2DM and it has been suggested that pharmacotherapy with metformin can also halt the development of T2DM in prediabetic patients.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
"26,27 Although strict glycemic strategies have not been shown to lower mortality in patients with acute MI and T2DM 28 current guidelines recommend that patients with established T2DM and prediabetes should be managed with lifestyle modification and/or medication in order to delay organ damage.",Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Therefore the identification of metabolic derangements among ACS patients may have important therapeutic implications that could be used to improve long-term outcome.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
The American Heart Association and ADA recommend dietary counseling and regular physical activity for patients with CAD and T2DM to lose weight and lower cardiovascular risk in addition to strict hypertension and cholesterol management.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
29 The UK Prospective Diabetes Study was a large study on patients with newly diagnosed T2DM who were assigned to be treated with sulfonylurea or insulin metformin or dietary restrictions.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
30 Even though the difference in HbA1c was lost after the first year a reduction in all-cause mortality and MI was maintained during 10 years of follow-up in the groups treated with medications as compared with the patients who received only dietary recommendations.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
This phenomenon of long-term risk reduction of future cardiovascular events and death after early strict glycemic control indicates benefit of strict glucose managements especially in patients of age 60 and younger.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
The DIGAMI 2 trial showed benefit of metformin in patients with MI and T2DM to reduce risk of non-fatal reinfarction or stroke while surprisingly patients treated with strict insulin regimens had an increased risk of death reinfarction or stroke.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
28,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
This suggests that metformin should be part of standard care among patients with T2DM and CAD.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
The SGLT-2 inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin are glycemic-lowering agents that have been shown to lower risk of death when added to standard care among patients with T2DM.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
"31,32 However is should be noted the studies on SGLT-2 inhibitors were published after the recruitment period of our study was completed and therefore only a few of our patients received SGLT-2 inhibitors during the follow-up period.",Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
No increased risk for cardiovascular events was found among ACS patients with newly detected prediabetes even though there was a clear trend in that direction.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
This could be because of the relatively small sample size and short follow-up period in this study as the progression from prediabetes to T2DM can take several years.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Some of the prediabetic patients will regress to NGM others remain prediabetic for years while yet other patients progress to overt T2DM.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
In our study only 2.9% of prediabetic patients were prescribed oral diabetes medication during the followup period which indicates that they were generally well controlled by lifestyle management.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
A limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size especially regarding patients with newly diagnosed prediabetes and T2DM and a relatively short follow-up period as T2DM is a chronic disease that causes chronic organ damage over a long period of time.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
We were unable to determine the duration of T2DM in each case of kT2DM as this assessment is subject to recall error and inaccuracy.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
Finally information regarding low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurements were not available at baseline.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
In conclusion ACS patients with kT2DM and nT2DM were at increased risk of death or MI and MACEs compared with ACS patients with NGM after approximately three years of follow-up.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0
These results underscore the importance for clinicians to be aware of potential glucometabolic derangements among patients with ACS and apply appropriate lifestyle recommendations and treatment.,Bjarnason 2019.txt,0

Although there is no evidence that mild hyperglycemia per se promotes atherogenesis or plaque rupture a 20year follow-up in the Whitehall Study the Paris Prospective Study and the Helsinki Policemen Study determined that a high blood glucose concentration is a risk factor for mortality in middle-aged nondiabetic subjects.,Fisman 2001.txt,0

Thus the current study indicates that this new ADA category is a marker for worse prognosis in nondiabetic coronary patients further supporting the hypothesis that there is a close-albeit not necessarily linear-relationship between glucose and cardiovascular disease that begins at normal levels and rises into the diabetic range.,Fisman 2001.txt,1
Problem-oriented prospective clinical trials are necessary to determine whether modification of dysglycemia translates into improved clinical outcomes or whether elevated glucose levels are simply markers of an underlying metabolic syndrome.,Fisman 2001.txt,0
The main findings of this retrospective study were as follows: (1) in DM patients with acute HF all-cause mortality Among the three groups the patients with IFG had a lower percentage of male and higher total cholesterol.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Patients with DM had a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease and levels of triglycerides.],Chen 2018.txt,0
[The mean period of follow-up was 2558 ± 1243 days.,Chen 2018.txt,0
During the follow-up period all-cause mortality was 44.1% (259 patients) cardiac mortality was 82.6% (214 patients) and HF re-hospitalization rate was 65.4% (384 patients).,Chen 2018.txt,0
As shown in Figure 1 the all-cause mortality of patients with DM IFG and non-DM were 55.5% (96/173) 40.3% (27/67) and 39.2% (136/347) with significant difference ( χ 2 = 12.887 P = 0.001).,Chen 2018.txt,0
Moreover compared with those with IFG (23/67 34.3%) and non-DM (113/347 32.6%) patients with DM also had significantly higher rate of cardiovascular mortality (78/173 45.1% χ 2 = 7.962 P = 0.019).,Chen 2018.txt,0
However there was no significant difference in HF re-hospitalization rate among the DM (124/173 71.7%) IFG (44/67 65.7%) and non-DM (216/347 62.2%) groups ( χ 2 = 4.538 P = 0.106).,Chen 2018.txt,0
Table 2 shows the variables for the prognosis of patients with acute HF.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Univariate analysis indicated that patients with IFG had a 1.8-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality and a 1.9-fold increased risk for cardiovascular mortality compared with patients with non-DM.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Likewise compared with patients with non-DM DM patients had 2.0-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality and 1.9-fold increased risk in cardiovascular mortality.,Chen 2018.txt,0
However neither IFG nor DM was associated with HF re-hospitalization.,Chen 2018.txt,0
The robustness of these associations held in multiple Cox regression analysis even after adjustment for multiple clinical risk factors with adjusted hazard ratio of 1.672 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.088-2.570 P = 0.019) in IFG and 1.936 (95% CI: 1.472-2.547; P < 0.001) in DM for all-cause mortality as well as 1.817 (95% CI: 1.135-2.909 P = 0.013) in IFG and 1.739 (95% CI: 1.285-2.354 P < 0.001) in DM for the cardiovascular mortality.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Nevertheless both of IFG and DM were not risk factors for HF re-hospitalization after adjusting for other risk factors.,Chen 2018.txt,0
rate and cardiovascular mortality were both higher than those with IFG and non-DM; (2) DM and IFG were both risk factors of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality even in patients with acute HF after adjustment for multiple established risk factors and potential confounding variables but not for HF re-hospitalization; (3) DM individuals who had strictly controlled or poorly controlled FPG both worse outcomes; and (4) overuse of insulin might be associated with a worse prognosis of DM patients with acute HF due to hypoglycemia risk.,Chen 2018.txt,0
There were limited studies examining the association between elevated admission FPG and adverse outcomes in patients with acute HF and these studies reported conflicting results.,Chen 2018.txt,0
The findings of this study were consistent with previous observations that patients with acute HF and DM had worse all-cause mortality compared to those without DM. Mebazaa et al. [13] reported that blood glucose levels of patients with acute HF at hospital admission were powerfully prognostic risks for 30-day mortality independent of previous DM. Similarly Targher et al. [22] showed that among patients hospitalized for acute HF the presence of DM was independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality 1-year all-cause mortality and 1-year re-hospitalizations for HF.,Chen 2018.txt,0
However the results of this study were contrast with those from other previous studies which suggested that elevated blood glucose or DM was not associated with medium-and long-term adverse outcomes.,Chen 2018.txt,0
For instance in the analysis of short-term clinical outcomes in the OPTIMIZE-HF registry Greenberg et al. [23] found that acute HF patients with known DM had similar in-hospital and postdischarge mortality rates compared to patients without DM but had a higher re-hospitalization rate.,Chen 2018.txt,0
"Moreover in a nationally representative cohort of 50,532 elderly patients with acute HF in the United States Kosiborod et al. [24] reported that blood glucose levels at hospital admission were not significantly related to an increased risk of 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality.",Chen 2018.txt,0
Finally the presence of diabetes was strongly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality but it did not significantly predict 1-year mortality or re-hospitalization rates in the cohort of 1176 inpatients from the Italian Network on HF Outcome registry.,Chen 2018.txt,1
[11],Chen 2018.txt,0
Hence as noted above there were limited and differing data about the role of blood glucose levels at admission on adverse outcomes in patients with acute HF.,Chen 2018.txt,0
The paradox may be explained by the following two reasons.,Chen 2018.txt,0
First as previous studies reported most studies consisted of patients with various demographic characteristics and different degrees of baseline cardiovascular risk.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Therefore the components of different studies were quite heterogeneous such as population age gender HF etiology blood pressure kidney function cardiac function and treatments.,Chen 2018.txt,0
The slight differences of any above components could influence the whole result.,Chen 2018.txt,0
"Second ""stress-induced hyperglycemia"" which is characterized by an abrupt and transient increase in blood glucose levels [25] is associated with higher short-term mortality rates than either previously known DM or normal glucose regulation.",Chen 2018.txt,1
[26],Chen 2018.txt,0
Thus stress-induced hyperglycemia is a confounder to real hyperglycemia caused by IFG or DM.,Chen 2018.txt,0
If so it was possible that some misclassification of IFG or DM under single blood glucose measurement and this misclassification could have partly overestimated the true prevalence of IFG or DM.,Chen 2018.txt,0
However transient stress-induced hyperglycemia has not been reported to be significantly associated with long-term adverse clinical outcomes.,Chen 2018.txt,0
[27],Chen 2018.txt,0
The main possible mechanisms for elevated levels of FPG in patients with acute HF are central obesity insulin resistance acute renal dysfunction and diuretics use. [28][29][30],Chen 2018.txt,0
Furthermore long-term hyperglycemic can impair endothelial function leading to arteriosclerosis a major cause of coronary heart disease.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Hyperglycemia induces secretion of higher levels of plasma insulin which may increase ventricular mass and decrease cardiac output and the insulin resistance-associated hyperglycemia is associated with the poor prognosis.,Chen 2018.txt,1
[31],Chen 2018.txt,0
In addition elevated levels of FPG and insulin activate the sympathetic nervous system which has been implicated in the development of HF.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Recent guidelines for the treatment of DM emphasize the importance of individualization of therapy based on patient demands comorbid conditions and potential side effects.,Chen 2018.txt,0
[21],Chen 2018.txt,0
Strict glycemic control is prone to higher risk of hypoglycemia and has been related to higher morbidity and mortality.,Chen 2018.txt,1
Several studies have found a U-shaped relationship between HbA1c values and mortality.,Chen 2018.txt,0
In a cohort of 5815 patients with HF and DM treated in ambulatory clinics individuals with modest glycemic control (7.1%< HbA1c ≤7.8%) had the lowest risk of death.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Moreover an inverse association between HbA1c values and adverse outcomes also has been reported in patients with DM and advanced HF. [32],Chen 2018.txt,0
In the present study DM individuals with modest FPG level (3.9 mmol/L≤ FPG <7.0 mmol/L) had the lowest risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event and a higher all-cause mortality was found in low FPG level group (FPG <3.9 mmol/L) where the rate of insulin use was significantly higher than oral glycemic agents (76.9% vs. 15.7% P < 0.01).,Chen 2018.txt,1
Although low FPG at admission could not completely represent the stable state of glycemic control it reflected a higher risk of mortality or morbidity caused by hypoglycemia.,Chen 2018.txt,1
Several mechanisms for the association above have been proposed.,Chen 2018.txt,0
First acute hypoglycemia induces catecholamine release due to sympathetic nervous activation that leads to Ca 2+ overload of the cardiomyocyte and hypokalemia both of which cause prolongation of the QT interval and can trigger ) free survival rates of cardiovascular event (c and d) and HF re-hospitalization event (e and f) among different groups of acute HF patients who were stratified by FPG levels.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Non-DM IFG and DM groups corresponded to groups G1 G2 and G3 in Figure 2a 2c and 2e; DM groups were further subdivided into three subgroups according to controlled FPG levels: FPG <3.9 mmol/L 3.9 mmol/L≤ FPG <7.0 mmol/L and FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L corresponding to groups g3 g4 and g5; non-DM and IFG groups corresponded to groups g1 and g2 in Figure 2b 2d and 2f. IFG: Impaired fasting glucose; DM: Diabetes mellitus; HF: Heart failure.,Chen 2018.txt,1
lethal arrhythmias. [33],Chen 2018.txt,0
Second hypoglycemia has harmful effects on myocardial metabolism with insulin resistance and may lead to increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure myocardial ischemia water-sodium retention and reduced left ventricular contraction.,Chen 2018.txt,0
[34],Chen 2018.txt,0
Furthermore hypoglycemia induces a hypercoagulant state through platelet aggregation and changes of plasma coagulant factors.,Chen 2018.txt,0
[35],Chen 2018.txt,0
All of these factors are linked to HF decompensations.,Chen 2018.txt,0
However there were no randomized controlled trials aiming for optimal glycemic targets specifically in acute HF patients with DM.,Chen 2018.txt,0
It is controversial whether low FPG is an epiphenomenon caused by brittleness of DM or a treatment-related effect due to strict glycemic control.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Therefore further studies assessing the effect of modulating FPG in DM patients on acute HF are warranted.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Our study had several strengths and limitations.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Patients were selected from two independent centers with a high follow-up rate.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Patients were prospectively monitored using established databases for hospital admission and telephone interview.,Chen 2018.txt,0
The follow-up period was sufficiently long to obtain the risk for HF in the general population.,Chen 2018.txt,0
In addition our registry provided evidence of the impact of different FPG levels on the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality as well as the association between glucose control and prognostic outcomes for DM.,Chen 2018.txt,0
However some important limitations of this registry include sample size lack of HbA1c data and lack of glucose tolerance test data.,Chen 2018.txt,0
First the sample size of this study was relatively small which slightly increased the sampling error and reduced the statistical power.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Second FPG was volatile and influenced by many factors.,Chen 2018.txt,0
The lack of comprehensive HbA1c data precluded exploring the combination of HbA1c and FPG which might represent a better state of glycemic control than FPG alone.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Third the hyperglycemic state would be change with the increase of age and inappropriate treatment such as non-DM might become IFG or DM in the future during follow-up.,Chen 2018.txt,0
However these data were not available.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Classification of IFG or DM based on a single FPG measurement might underestimate the impact of In conclusion the present study indicated that IFG and DM were associated with higher all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with acute HF.,Chen 2018.txt,1
No significant differences in HF re-hospitalization were observed among patients with IFG DM and non-DM.,Chen 2018.txt,0
DM patients with lower (FPG <3.9 mmol/L) or higher controlled FPG (FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L) both had worse survival outcomes.,Chen 2018.txt,1
These results demonstrated the importance of proper glycemic targets in HF patients with DM.,Chen 2018.txt,0
There remains a need for evidence-based guidelines for the management of in-hospital hyperglycemia among patients with acute HF and the impact of aggressive treatment of admission hyperglycemia on outcomes in this patient population needs to be further explored in randomized controlled trials.,Chen 2018.txt,0
Notably the ARIC analysis was based on an age range other than in the current study included different ethnicities and did not exclude or consider in adjusted models individuals with a history of myocardial infarcstroke Despite the finding of no association between prediabetes and all-cause mortality in the current study prediabetes might still be relevant for other clinical outcomes.,Paprott_2015.txt,0

[Our study the largest study to date demonstrates that 33% of AMI patients have a disorder in long-term glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c (4% newly diagnosed diabetes 29% pre-diabetes).,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Moreover newly diagnosed diabetes is associated with a significantly worse short and long-term prognosis which interestingly is as poor as in patients with known DM.,Hermanides 2019.txt,1

Our study represents a large dataset utilising several years of routine admission HbA1c measurements in all STEMI and NSTEMI patients and so provides a unique insight into the natural history of glycaemic derangement on long-term mortality in a large group of ACS patients.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0

[Newly diagnosed DM and pre-DM patients as represented by our data are truly a high ischaemic risk patient population as manifested by a higher cardiovascular risk profile.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
They more frequently have a history of previous MI previous PCI and previous CABG.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Furthermore on coronary angiography when compared to patients without DM they significantly more often have multivessel coronary disease.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Furthermore in the subset of STEMI patients in our database patients with newly diagnosed diabetes have a higher prevalance of previous cardiac events and they present later in the hospital (resulting in a longer total ischaemic time).,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
In a considerable subset of patients with diabetes clinical signs of MI may present differently with less or even absent pain sensations.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
This different presentation is ascribed to the presence of neuropathy.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Although this might be a possible explanation in newly diagnosed DM as well this seems less probable because the development of neuropathy takes years of glycometabolic dysregulation.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Such a long-term undetected dysregulation would be quite rare in our opinion.],Hermanides 2019.txt,0
[With this routine HbA1c measurement on admission in this large AMI cohort we identified 350 patients with newly diagnosed DM. However only 34.7% of them received any DM medication (oral and/or insulin) at discharge.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Adequate treatment in recently diagnosed patients with diabetes is of paramount importance.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Svensson et al. recently showed that adequate treatment attaining a strict HbA1c goal of less than 48 mmol/l within 6 months in recently diagnosed DM patients treated with metformin (currently the first oral blood glucose-lowering agent of choice according to the ADA guidelines) was associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events and mortality with cardiovascular risk gradually increasing at higher HbA1c levels.,Hermanides 2019.txt,1
28,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
So this population (newly diagnosed DM and pre-DM patients) may need better follow-up and treatment in the post-infarct trajectory of glucose dysregulation which is in accordance with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0

Other risk factors such as hypertension and overweight would also need more attention when taking into account the more frequent occurrence of overweight and hypertension in the pre-DM and newly diagnosed DM population.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
Early identification of high HbA1c concentrations enables the initiation of specific intervention strategies and may help us develop strategies to improve prognosis in these high-risk patient groups.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0
This is of particular importance because there is a global increase in the number of patients with cardiovascular disease with pre-diabetes newly diagnosed diabetes underlying insulin resistance and overt diabetes mellitus.,Hermanides 2019.txt,0

However we do not corroborate suggestions that classifying a higher number of South Asians as having prediabetes when HbA 1c criteria are used results in a less discriminative indicator of CVD risk (18) since for CHD prediabetes by any criterion appeared unrelated in South Asians and for stroke prediabetes by all criteria was associated.,Eastwood_2015.txt,1
This may have resulted in more aggressive and long-standing management.,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
Another possibility is that South Asians respond better to lipid lowering though this appears unlikely (33).,Eastwood_2015.txt,0
There are two main findings of the present study.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In well-characterized chronic HFrEF patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure previously undetected prediabetes and T2DM were highly prevalent affecting 63% of the cohort.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
During the follow-up compared with normoglycaemic individuals patients with prediabetes as well as patients with newly diagnosed T2DM had an independently increased long-term risk for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality even after adjustment for multiple potential confounders.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
The first finding reveals a high proportion (63%) of patients hospitalized for worsening chronic HFrEF with previously unrecognized prediabetes (43%) or T2DM (19%).,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In the present study both FPG and 2h OGTT were used for diagnosing dysglycaemia which has improved both diagnostic specificity and sensitivity as reflected in identification of 62 (52%) new cases of prediabetes or T2DM among patients with normal FPG.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In comparison in the post hoc analysis of the PARADIGM HF trial prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM were established based on HbA 1c levels in 39% and 21% of chronic stable HFrEF patients respectively which is similar to our results.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
12 Conversely in the GISSI-HF a lower proportion of chronic heart failure patients had prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM (29% and 13% respectively) compared with our findings.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In a large cohort of HFrEF outpatients in Denmark without previously established T2DM 19% presented with overt T2DM whereas 22% had prediabetes.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
3,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
The reasons behind differences in the frequency of dysglycaemia across studies are currently unresolved and could be attributed to several factors including geographic variations and differences in the severity and clinical presentation of heart failure.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
23 Accordingly there is a positive correlation between heart failure severity as indicated by a higher NYHA functional class and insulin resistance.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
24,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
This supports the high prevalence of prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM amongst our patients with NYHA class II-III symptoms.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Likewise in several studies T2DM was more prevalent in acute or worsening heart failure than in stable chronic heart failure which is also in line with our findings.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
"7,[25][26][27]",Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In addition in contrast to the use of HbA 1c in most trials patients in our study were stratified according to the 2-h OGTT which has comparable sensitivity but an imperfect concordance with HbA 1c .,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
19 Importantly the feasibility of the 2-h OGTT in heart failure patients has been previously confirmed.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
The relevance of undetected prediabetes or T2DM is reflected in substantially increased mortality rates associated with dysglycaemia in our study.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Despite being treated with modern agents patients with newly diagnosed prediabetes or T2DM had higher rates of allcause ($10-17 per 100 patient-years) and cardiovascular ($10-14 per 100 patient-years) mortality compared with normoglycaemic individuals.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In addition mortality rates attributed to prediabetes and T2DM exceeded reports from earlier studies.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In the PARADIGM HF trial crude incidence rates of all-cause (8-9 per 100 patient-years) and cardiovascular ($8 per 100 patient-years) mortality in patients with prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM were lower than in our study.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
12 Likewise in the CHARM and GISSI-HF trials mortality rates associated with prediabetes were lower than in our cohort.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
"4,11",Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
The observed discrepancies could be related to differences in study populations.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Namely these trials have enrolled chronic stable HFrEF patients whereas our study included patients hospitalized for worsening chronic HFrEF with NYHA class II-III symptoms.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Worsening heart failure is considered a critical point in the course of heart failure associated with a sharp increase in short-term and long-term mortality.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
[28][29][30],Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
This is corroborated by a post hoc analysis of the EVEREST trial (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan) in which the rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were significantly higher in patients with than without diabetes with acute or worsening heart failure which supports our findings.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
7 The high mortality rates in patients with prediabetes and T2DM translated into a substantially higher longterm risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death compared with normoglycaemic individuals in our study even after adjusting for relevant confounders.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
The observed hazard ratios were high which could be explained by the small sample size of our study.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Notwithstanding the high frequency of prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM in heart failure its impact on heart failure progression and survival outcomes has remained unresolved.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Most evidence is derived from clinical trials and registries of patients with chronic stable HFrEF in whom known T2DM has been consistently associated with higher risks of death and heart failure hospitalization although in some older trials the risk was higher in patients with ischaemic heart failure and in females.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
[31][32][33][34][35],Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
These disparities were not corroborated in subsequent analyses and the results of interaction analysis in the present study also suggest that dysglycaemia confers a worse prognosis independof heart failure aetiology or gender.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Unlike chronic HFrEF available data in patients with acute or worsening chronic HFrEF are inconsistent and mostly confined to the assessment of known T2DM.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In the Italian IN-HF (Italian Network on Heart Failure) registry known T2DM and hyperglycaemia at admission were strong predictors of in-hospital mortality but had no effect on one-year risk of death.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
36 Conversely post hoc analysis of several clinical trials as well as data from a large pan-European long-term heart failure registry indicate that known T2DM is a strong predictor of impaired survival one-year and beyond following hospitalization for acute or worsening chronic heart failure.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
"7,27,35,37",Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Our findings confirm and extend these observations by demonstrating that in addition to known T2DM prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM are not only common in patients hospitalized with worsening HFrEF but also independently associated with impaired long-term survival following heart failure hospitalization.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
Although common these abnormalities often remain clinically undetected or underappreciated and consequently expose the patients to the long-standing risk of heart failure progression.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
38,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In addition following an episode for acute or worsening HFrEF patients may become more vulnerable to the harmful effects of dysglycaemia as suggested by our findings.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
As compared with normoglycaemic individuals patients with prediabetes not treated with glucose lowering medications had a substantially higher mortality rate which strongly supports the notion of a detrimental effect of dysglycaemia per se on heart failure progression.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
"Based on our results and concordant with current guidelines 15,23,39 there are several lines of preventive measures worthy of consideration.",Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
First adopting a widespread screening of heart failure patients without known T2DM with either 2-h OGTT or HbA 1c could decrease the burden of these conditions and enable a timely application of preventive strategies.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
23 Although optimal management of prediabetes in heart failure remains to be defined a benefit could be expected from lifestyle modifications (e.g. healthy eating pattern and increased physical activity) with a proven ability to delay the progression to overt T2DM.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
40 Notably in a randomized trial assessing the effects of exercise training in patients with HFrEF patients with diabetes exhibited lower functional capacity and attenuated response to exercise compared with normoglycaemic individuals.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
41 Despite these limitations there was no interaction between T2DM and exercise on clinical outcomes (i.e. mortality and hospitalization).,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
41 Recent data suggest that exercise training following an episode of worsening heart failure could be safe and effective in improving functional capacity and endothelial function in heart failure.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
[42][43][44],Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
It is plausible that patients with prediabetes and HFrEF may be more responsive to the benefits of exercise but this remains to be determined.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In addition it might be worth assessing whether enhanced glycaemic control with sacubitril/valsartan observed in diabetics with HFrEF could be extended to patients with prediabetes.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
45 Finally our results stress the importance of better understanding the role of treatment across a broader range of glucometabolic abnormalities in heart failure aiming to achieve timely and effective prevention of adverse events.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
There are several limitations of our study.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Most importantly this was a single-centre study with a small number of enrolled patients which has reduced the statistical power and resulted in high hazard ratios with wide CIs.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Exclusion of patients with established T2DM precluded comparing the risk across the whole range of glucometabolic impairments in patients with worsening HFrEF.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Also HbA 1c levels in our patients could not be provided because of a significant proportion of missing data.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Furthermore considering that the assessment of glycaemic status was performed only once there is a possibility that in some patients prediabetes and T2DM were misclassified due to the effects of stress-induced hyperglycaemia and/or reduced insulin sensitivity.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Certainly repeating 2-h OGTT after discharge would have increased the diagnostic accuracy for dysglycaemia.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
Still our results are consistent with previous studies in similar patient populations and provide clinically relevant information that needs to be confirmed in a larger study.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0
In conclusion unrecognized prediabetes and T2DM are common in patients hospitalized for worsening chronic HFrEF with NYHA class II-III symptoms and are independently associated with a higher longterm risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,1
Our results highlight the importance of screening for unrecognized prediabetes and T2DM in the setting of worsening HFrEF.,Pavlovic 2019.txt,0

The present findings are unique because they originate from a very large study population with a high participation rate and an unusually long period of follow-up.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Combined with a complete registration of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality based on official registries and hospital records this should make the study well suited to explore the importance of glucose abnormalities including those newly detected.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
A potential limitation is the lack of an originally defined heart failure algorithm in the study protocol because heart failure is a diagnosis based on clinical criteria and thereby is less well suited for epidemiological studies.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0

Hyper-tension together with myocardial infarction was the main risk factor for heart failure in the Framingham study [18].,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,1
Likewise the Rotterdam Study showed an increased risk  of heart failure in participants with ischaemic heart disease [19].,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
The present finding that previous myocardial infarction was more prevalent in participants with heart failure is thus not surprising.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Participants with diabetes had an increased risk of developing a new myocardial infarction further illustrating the relationship between glucometabolic perturbations and ischaemic heart disease.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0

The unfavourable vital prognosis in diabetic patients with left ventricular dysfunction has often been related to the presence of a widespread and diffuse coronary artery disease causing ischaemic cardiomyopathy [22].,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,1
The fact that mortality differences in the present study remained after adjustments makes ischaemic heart disease a less likely single explanation for the increased mortality.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0

The present study did however not reveal a poorer prognosis of participants with the combination of a glucose abnormality and heart failure when compared with participants with either disease occurring separately.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Our results do not therefore add complete evidence for the existence of a specific diabetic cardiomyopathy.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Too few participants in the groups glucose abnormalities and heart failure is the most likely explanation for the lack of a statistically significant impaired prognosis compared with that with either disease.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
In a study of elderly patients with diabetes Bertoni et al. [26] found a significantly higher mortality in those with heart failure and diabetes with those with diabetes only.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Gustafson et [5] noted that diabetes is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with heart failure.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0

To the best of our knowledge the present investigation is the only truly population-based epidemiological study.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0
Additive information supporting the existence of a diabetic cardiomyopathy would be that improved glucometabolic control in individuals with the combination of glucose abnormality and heart failure improve their prognosis irrespective of the existence of ischaemic heart disease.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,0

The study also utilised whole-body densitometry for the assessment of body fat mass and lean mass which more accurately assesses body composition estimated from anthropometric measurements [36].,de_Abreu_2017.txt,0

"These data provide evidence for the following conclusions: 1) the new 2010 American Diabetes Association glycated hemoglobin cut points predict future risk of kidney disease and are associated with prevalent retinop-athy even after adjustment for known risk factors; 2) although risk was clearly strongest among individuals with a history of diabetes we were unable to firmly demonstrate the presence of a natural ""glycemic threshold"" in these data (3,11); and 3) in this community-based population glycated hemoglobin performed as well as fasting glucose and was superior in some circumstances for identifying individuals at risk for microvascular outcomes.",Selvin 2011.txt,0
Few studies have examined the prospective association of glycated hemoglobin with incident kidney disease in the absence of diagnosed diabetes (29).,Selvin 2011.txt,0
We previously demonstrated an independent association between glycated hemoglobin and risk of chronic kidney disease in individuals with diabetes even in the absence of albuminuria and retinopathy in the ARIC Study (30).,Selvin 2011.txt,0
In the present study elevated values of glycated hemoglobin at baseline were associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease even in the absence of a diagnosis of diabetes and glycated hemoglobin was a better predictor as compared with fasting glucose.,Selvin 2011.txt,0
"Our results are consistent with other recent studies (31)(32)(33) and are relevant to the controversy regarding the presence of a ""glycemic threshold"" for retinopathy i.e. the presence of a threshold below which glycemia is not strongly associated with retinopathy and above which there is clear association (3,11).",Selvin 2011.txt,1
"This evidence is primarily based on three early epidemiologic studies (4,5,34).",Selvin 2011.txt,0
"Recent studies that employed more sensitive techniques for the identification of retinopathy however indicate that the association between glycemia and retinopathy is continuous with no clear natural threshold (2,35).",Selvin 2011.txt,0
One difficulty in interpretation of the literature is that prior studies have examined this association in a mixed population of individuals with and without diabetes.,Selvin 2011.txt,0
"Examining the cross-sectional association of glycated hemoglobin and prevalent retinopathy in populations that include individuals with diabetes who may have received lifestyle and/or pharmacologic interventions to lower glycated hemoglobin is problematic; the onset of microvascular disease may have occurred years earlier and the ""risk thresholds"" observed for glycated hemoglobin in these studies may not accurately reflect values at which risk begins to increase.",Selvin 2011.txt,0
We showed the relationships of glycated hemoglobin and microvascular disease end points separately in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals demonstrating differential associations of glycated hemoglobin with retinopathy in diabetic (strong association with mild retinopathy) and nondiabetic individuals (weak or no association).,Selvin 2011.txt,0
Although the ETDRS classification system may have limitations for defining retinopathy in individuals without diabetes (36) the lack of association between mild retinopathy and glycemia and the robust associations with hypertension in individuals without diabetes suggests that the early retinal abnormalities of microaneurysms and retinal hemorrhages have a hypertensive or other etiology (37).,Selvin 2011.txt,1
"Our results highlight the difficulty in defining ""diabetic retinopathy"" in a nondiabetic population and speak to the need for long-term prospective studies of microvascular disease in initially nondiabetic adults.",Selvin 2011.txt,0
Limitations that should be considered in the interpretation of these data include the following: retinal photographs were taken in only one eye which may have resulted in low sensitivity for the detection of retinopathy (2) leading to misclassification of cases as noncases.,Selvin 2011.txt,0
Further the retinal exam in all ARIC participants was  conducted at visit 3 and glycated hemoglobin measurements are only available at visit 2 (3 years earlier).,Selvin 2011.txt,0
We also only had serum creatinine measured during one subsequent visit for the detection of decreased kidney function to define kidney disease.,Selvin 2011.txt,0

In middle-aged community-dwelling individuals without diabetes who were apparently cardiovascular healthy and without any known malignancy a combination of impaired fasting glucose and silent myocardial ischaemia as measured by 48-h Holter monitoring provided a 4-fold increased risk of death and ⁄ or myocardial infarction.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
After correction for covariates identified as the Framingham risk factors of myocardial infarction [19] there remained a residual risk for meeting the combined endpoint of 2.5-fold as compared with persons with a normal fasting glucose and no silent myocardial ischaemia.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
However the prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia was not significantly different between subjects with or without impaired fasting glucose.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
There is no obvious explanation for this but it may be attributable to shorter duration of impaired fasting glucose in the population or exclusion of subjects with manifest coronary artery disease or cardiovascular death.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
To our knowledge this is the first study of prevalence and prognostic significance of silent myocardial ischaemia in apparently healthy community-dwelling subjects with pre-diabetes.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
The fact that impaired fasting glucose per se exhibited prognostic value is in accordance with the results of previous studies including a meta-analysis of 20 prospective studies which observed a significant graded relationship between increasing levels of fasting and postprandial glucose concentration and risk of cardiovascular events [20][21][22][23].,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
Further adjustment for hs-CRP and NT-proBNP did not change the results significantly which indicates that the poor prognosis associated with impaired fasting glucose is beyond the effect of these covariates.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0

Among individuals without apparent heart disease the predictive value of silent myocardial ischaemia as detected by Holter monitoring has not been studied properly.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study which studied asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals showed that 61% of the subjects with significant heart disease had a positive Holter test and only 47% of these subjects had a positive stress myocardial perfusion test (SPECT).,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
"In addition comparative studies demonstrated that silent myocardial ischaemia as detected by Holter monitoring was a significant predictor of an adverse outcome while ST-segment depression on exercise testing did not predict an adverse outcome [26,27].",Intzilakis 2012.txt,0

This study is not aimed to compare silent myocardial ischaemia detected by each test but to focus on the pathophysiological phenomenon and the prospect of using it in clinical practice.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
Because of the relatively low prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia in these subjects screening is not recommended in unselected populations.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
Detecting a subpopulation with a higher prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia may be a key issue if this should be implemented in screening protocols.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0

The present study used the classification of impaired fasting glucose suggested by The Expert Committee [30] and even although we did not perform coronary angiography our results support the hypothesis that the combination of impaired fasting glucose and silent myocardial ischaemia were associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
In fact the same association was observed when we used World Health Organization [31] classification and diagnostic criteria of pre-dia-betes defining impaired fasting glucose as fasting plasma glucose 6.1-6.9 mmol ⁄ l (data not shown).,Intzilakis 2012.txt,1
These present findings must be reproduced before a firm conclusion can be drawn on the clinical significance of an increased risk of adverse endpoints in those subjects with combined impaired fasting glucose and silent myocardial infarction.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
The study exhibits additional limitations i.e. the numbers of events in the group of interest were rather few which limit the statistical power on endpoints.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
The data on glucose tolerance were derived from fasting plasma glucose only thus the lack of a standard oral glucose challenge may limit the interpretation of the association between glucose tolerance and silent myocardial ischaemia.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0
As we used all-cause death as part of the endpoint it is not possible to determine whether cardiovascular disease mortality is an important contributor.,Intzilakis 2012.txt,0

In addition to being classified based on HbA1c levels prediabetes can be diagnosed from fasting glucose concentrations or oral glucose tolerance tests [1].,Rebnord 2015.txt,1
Unfortunately these measures were not available for our study population.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
Hence we were not able to compare the prognostic implications from different definitions of pre-diabetes [49].,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
All the included patients underwent elective coronary angiography for suspected stable CAD and the majority received medications for CVD risk reduction including aspirin and statins.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
Consequently our findings may not necessarily be generalizable to other patient groups or to healthy individuals.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
Racial disparities regarding HbA1c values have been reported [50].,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
As our cohort consists almost exclusively of Caucasians our results are unlikely to be confounded by ethnicity but may not necessarily apply to non-Caucasian populations.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
"The current study found that Chinese CAD patients with IFG newly diagnosed diabetes and known diabetes were associated with increased risks of allcause and CVD mortality compared with Chinese CAD patients with In agreement with our results two early American studies reported that among CAD patients both IFG (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/L) and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of mortality compared with normoglycemia (27,28).",Ding 2014.txt,1
In contrast with our study they did not have OGTT measurements so they could not further evaluate the risk of IGT and IGR.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Although we used new ADA standards (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) to define IFG this threshold still can predict an increased risk of mortality.,Ding 2014.txt,1
Displayed by spline plots we found a J-shaped relationship between the baseline FPG and subsequent death of all-cause and CVD; the cut point of increase in the risk was apparent for glucose level which was below current diabetic threshold even the IFG threshold.,Ding 2014.txt,0
This finding was consistent with the previous Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Europe (DECODE) study.,Ding 2014.txt,0
In their meta-analysis there was a J-shaped relation between FPG and all-cause CVD and non-CVD mortality among European general populations.,Ding 2014.txt,0
And the thresholds of increase of risk were 5.3 mmol/L for all-cause mortality and 5.4 mmol/L for CVD mortality (12).,Ding 2014.txt,1
Thus our study confirmed the prognostic significance of the current ADA recommendation for the lower IFG threshold in Chinese patients with CAD.,Ding 2014.txt,0
The Euro Heart Survey found that only CAD patients with both known and newly diagnosed diabetes but not with IGR were at high risk of mortality during the 1-year follow-up period (13).,Ding 2014.txt,0
Besides the different ethnicities there were some other differences in the methods between our study and the Euro Heart Survey which may result in this contrary conclusion.,Ding 2014.txt,0
The Euro Heart Survey only focused on 1-year outcome which may not be long enough to observe the difference in prognosis of the IGR group.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Second the Euro Heart Survey did not report the separate analysis on the classification of patients based on OGTT or FPG only due to small sample size.,Ding 2014.txt,0
But they did care.diabetesjournals.org,Ding 2014.txt,0
Ding and Associates 551 observe a higher prevalence of mortality in IFG and IGT patients although the differences remained insignificant.,Ding 2014.txt,0
The current study also showed that in comparison with known diabetic CAD patients the risk of death from all causes and CVD was a little higher in newly diagnosed diabetic patients.,Ding 2014.txt,0
This might be because not all the newly diagnosed patients were patients with new onset of diabetes.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Some of them had diabetes for a period of time but were undiagnosed which was proven by the Chinese high undiagnosed rate of diabetes (2).,Ding 2014.txt,0
Lack of monitoring and control of glucose might partly explain the higher risk of mortality compared with known diabetic patients 69% of whom took antidiabetic drugs at baseline in our cohort.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Moreover our patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had more severe CAD and shared more harmful lifestyles.,Ding 2014.txt,0
The rates of smoking and alcohol drinking were higher and the physical activity time was less in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Since   There are some limitations in the present study.,Ding 2014.txt,0
First our subjects were enrolled from hospitals which may bring about selection bias.,Ding 2014.txt,0
In general inpatients are considered as having a more severe disease status than nonhospitalized patients.,Ding 2014.txt,1
However we included both acute CAD patients and those with stable manifestation and some of them were electively admitted patients with mild status.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Thus we can reduce the bias.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Second only some of the study samples conducted OGTTs due to the clinical practice rituals and patient will.,Ding 2014.txt,0
"To evaluate the impact of this shortcoming we performed separate subgroup analyses in 1,118 CAD patients with both FPG and 2-h glucose measurements compared with 1,724 CAD patients of all our study samples with full FPG measurements and some 2-h glucose measurements.",Ding 2014.txt,0
In general the significant associations of known and newly diagnosed diabetes with all-cause and CVD mortality were not influenced substantially.,Ding 2014.txt,0
But the HRs of IFG and IGT patients were statistically insignificant which may be due to missing OGTTs of the high-risk patients.,Ding 2014.txt,0
Third we cannot completely exclude the effects of residual confounding resulting from measurement error in the assessment of confounding factors or some unmeasured factors.,Ding 2014.txt,0
In conclusion our study confirms that IFG newly diagnosed diabetes and known diabetes are all associated with increased risks of all-cause and CVD mortality among CAD patients and patients with IGR had significantly higher risk for CVD mortality and marginally greater risk for all-cause mortality.,Ding 2014.txt,1

Our results suggest that addition of a random blood glucose at the time of a lipid profile is likely to add little to the prediction of CHD among those below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes while potentially benefitting those close to or above the threshold.],Brunner_2010.txt,0
These results point to the need to identify the clustering of metabolic aberrations accompanying the MetS.,Liu_2007.txt,0
Our results are concordant with the findings from Framingham Heart Study 29 that the associated CVD risk for various number and combinations of MetS components was heterogeneous.,Liu_2007.txt,0
The data are consistent with the concept that the Chinese population is susceptible to development of multiple cardiovascular risk factors with onset of obesity.,Liu_2007.txt,0
We demonstrated that 8% of young stroke survivors developed diabetes during a mean follow-up of 10 years after stroke which is more than two times higher than expected compared with persons from a Dutch general practitioner registry with similar age and sex [19].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Moreover we showed that among those patients without diabetes at the follow-up assessment 21% had impaired fasting blood glucose values.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
In our study both patients with diabetes and patients with IFG at the follow-up assessment were about three times more likely to experience any vascular event during followup than those with normal fasting blood glucose values.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
To our knowledge our study is the first to evaluate the incidence of diabetes after stroke in young adults and to study the association between fasting blood glucose values and recurrent vascular events.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Moreover our study has the longest follow-up period reported and one of the largest study populations in the field of young stroke.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Collecting data all in one site allowed us to collect baseline and follow-up information according to identical procedures in all patients thereby reducing the risk of information bias.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Our study has some limitations.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
First it may be that not all cases of young stroke in our catchment area were included in our cohort because our cohort is a single-center hospital-based study rather than community-based.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Only those patients who sustained a fatal stroke who were not admitted to our hospital would not have been included in our study.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Patients who survive usually visit a university medical center during the course of their disease.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
In addition there are no restrictions to be admitted to our hospital and we included all consecutive cases admitted.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
We therefore presume that our study population is a representative sample of Dutch patients with young stroke although formal data are lacking to prove this generalizability.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Second we investigated the association of IFG and diabetes with recurrent vascular events during follow-up in a cross-sectional analysis on average 10 years after the index event in patients that survived until the follow-up assessment.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Data are given as number (percentage) or otherwise stated *Scores range from 0 to 42 with higher scores on the scale indicating worse stroke severity.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
0.5% of NIHSS was missing.],Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
[Smoking was defined as smoking at least 1 cigarette a day in the year prior to the event.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,1
1.9% of data on smoking was missing.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
`Excess alcohol consumption was defined as consuming more than 200 grams of pure alcohol per week 1 First degree family member.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,1
0.9% of data on family history of diabetes was missing.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087171.t001,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Thus the measurement of blood glucose values is done after a recurrent event occurred.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
This may have induced survivor bias.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
IFG and diabetes may be associated with the severity of the recurrent event and as a consequence patients with IFG and diabetes may be underrepresented in survivors with recurrent events which may have attenuated the association between IFG/ diabetes and recurrent events.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Furthermore IFG was only measured at the follow-up assessment whereas for diabetes also a diagnosis established during the follow-up period was taken in account.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Diabetes that developed during follow-up might otherwise have been missed at the follow-up assessment due to initiated treatment.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Third some patients were lost to follow-up or refused to participate which potentially could have resulted in selection bias.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
However non-participants did not differ in baseline characteristic from participants making selection bias in this group unlikely.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Fourth our study has a long inclusion period during which diagnostic equipment acute treatment and secondary prevention have improved.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
However this is an unavoidable feature of a longterm follow-up study.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Furthermore the long follow-up period might have resulted in recall bias with respect to vascular events.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
However this probably would have underestimated the association between diabetes and recurrent vascular events since the incidence of diabetes was strongly related to the number of followup years.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Fifth secondary prevention might have influenced our results.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
In our study about 90% of all patients used secondary preventive medication at discharge.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Consequently the shown risk of recurrent vascular events might be an underestimation attributable to the use of this preventive medication.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Sixth as is reflected by the wide CIs estimates for some subgroups that contain only a few patients might be unstable and should therefore be interpreted with caution.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
So far the only studies reporting on epidemiology of diabetes in young stroke patients restricted their reports to diabetes diagnosed prior to stroke.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
"The proportion of patients with a medical history of diabetes varied widely in these studies ranging from 2-12% [7,20,21].",Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Our observed prevalence of diabetes based on the medical history of 4.9% is in the middle of this range.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
We showed in univariate analysis that incident diabetes after TIA or ischemic stroke was associated with age likely atherothrombotic stroke and family history of diabetes which are among well established risk factors for diabetes in the general population.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
In addition we showed that both patients with diabetes and patients with IFG were far more likely to have experienced any arterial during follow-up than those with normal fasting blood glucose values.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
These results suggest an intimate relationship in young stroke patients between pre-existent vulnerability to atherosclerosis and incident diabetes which is an atherogenic risk factor itself.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
However it is also possible that diabetes was already present but not revealed during the index event.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
p values refer to a comparison between patients with IFG and patients with no IFG or diabetes `Scores range from 0 to 42 with higher scores on the scale indicating worse stroke severity.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
0.4% of NIHSS was missing.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
1 Smoking was defined as smoking at least 1 cigarette a day in the year prior to the event.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,1
2.9% of data on smoking was missing.],Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
"[Excess alcohol consumption was defined as consuming more than 200 grams of pure alcohol per week "" First degree family member.",Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,1

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087171.t002,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Incident diabetes or IFG was not associated with recurrent stroke.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
An explanation might be that diabetes needs to be present for many years to be a risk factor for recurrent stroke.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
This is in line with a previous study in young adults with ischemic stroke that showed that among patients with type 1 diabetes duration of diabetes was on average 10 years longer in those with recurrent stroke versus those without recurrent stroke [7].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Another explanation for the lack of association might be the possibility of index event bias [22].,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
a study investigating recurrence patients are included based on the occurrence of the first event that is similar to the recurrent event.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
This has an effect on the distribution of risk factors in this selected population and the association of these risk factors with the outcome of interest.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
The high incidence of diabetes during our long follow-up period but also the high proportion of patients with IFG emphasizes that young stroke survivors remain vulnerable to the development of (risk factors for) vascular disease even decades after their initial stroke.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Active screening for IFG and diabetes after stroke in young adults may allow for early diagnoses of IFG and diabetes and thereby provide a therapeutic window to lower the risk of recurrent vascular events.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
Similar to the general population young stroke patients with a higher age having other vascular risk factors or a family history of diabetes might benefit the most from active screening.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
To conclude IFG and diabetes after stroke in young patients may remain unnoticed in many patients.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0
A regular screening for IFG and diabetes after young stroke particularly in those with increasing age having other vascular risk factors or a family history of diabetes yields potential for secondary prevention.,Rutten-Jacobs 2014.txt,0

"""In the Seven Countries Study diabetes was associated with a and IGT with a 1.17-fold mortality risk in a Finnish population aged 65-84 years.",Hiltunen_2005.txt,1
It is possible that peoples status might have changed upon subsequent assessment; this may have resulted in regression dilution bias.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Several could explain these findings.,Ma_2003.txt,0
Given that IFG and IGT are thought to be intermediate stages in the development of diabetes arising from the same pathologic processes it is possible that the high prevalence of IFG/IGT among Chinese is a consequence of slower progression to diabetes in this ethnic group.,Ma_2003.txt,1
Finally we also considered the possibility that these ethnic groups possess other risk factors for cardiovascular disease not examined in this study.,Ma_2003.txt,0
of the current screening strategies which currently recommend limiting the use of an oral glucose tolerance test to persons with a fasting glucose level greater than 6.0 mmol/liter and less than 7.0 mmol/liter (34) may be required to optimize the detection of persons with IGT.,Ma_2003.txt,0
The main findings of this study in patients who predominantly had CAD are as follows.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
First glycated hemoglobin is a significant predictor of all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality showing trends toward J-shaped associations with all three end points.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Second the relationships of glycated hemoglobin with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality are independent of fasting glucose.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Third the association of fasting glucose with mortality is not significant when glycated hemoglobin is included as a covariate.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Finally high glycated hemoglobin is strongly associated with increased risk of new onset diabetes diagnosed according to the ADA criteria of 2009 (8).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,1
Several previous studies have demonstrated continuous positive correlations of glycated hemoglobin with mortality and even subclinical cardiovascular disease in subjects without a history of diabetes (10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
However in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study a J-shaped relationship between glycated hemoglobin and all-cause mortality was observed (5).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Similarly U-shaped relationships of glycated hemoglobin with all-cause and cause-specific mortality including death from cardiovascular diseases and cancer were found in a large New Zealand collective (16).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
These data were supported by a study in insurance applicants (17).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
We also observed a trend toward a J-shaped correlation between glycated hemoglobin and mortality in our cohort of subjects at intermediateto-high cardiovascular risk.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
In agreement analyses in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study and the San Antonio Heart Study showed an association between low fasting glucose and increased allcause and cardiovascular mortality (18).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Low glycated hemoglobin and low fasting glucose potentially reflect chronic consuming illness that may lead to early death (18).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,1
"Apart from that the lowest glycated hemoglobin quintile was prima vista characterized by a favorable cardiovascular risk factor profile and low comorbidity Figure 1-Survival curves for (A) all-cause and (B) cardiovascular mortality calculated with Cox proportional hazards models (model 3) according to categories of glycated hemoglobin (1: ,5% 2: 5-5.4% 3: 5.5-5.9% 4: 6.0-6.4% 5: 6.5-7.4% and 6: $7.5%).",Silbernagel 2011.txt,1
as reflected by the Charlson comorbidity index.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
A main objective was to compare the predictive value of fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin in participants of the LURIC study.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
It is noteworthy that we were able to confirm that the association of glycated hemoglobin with mortality is independent of fasting glucose but not vice versa.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
This finding suggests that glycated hemoglobin may be superior to fasting glucose in the prediction of mortality (5).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
"Finally our data confirm that glycated hemoglobin is strongly correlated with new onset or future type 2 diabetes diagnosed according to the ADA criteria of 2009 (5,(19)(20)(21)(22).",Silbernagel 2011.txt,1
However type 2 diabetes was also diagnosed in 7.1% of the LURIC participants belonging to the lowest glycated hemoglobin category.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
This proportion is markedly increased compared with the 0.8% reported by Selvin et al. (5).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
"The difference between the two studies is accounted for by the fact that we performed OGTT in the majority of the LURIC participants with fasting glucose levels ,126 mg/dL.",Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Based on fasting glucose levels new onset type 2 diabetes would have been diagnosed in 1.8% of the LURIC participants in the lowest glycated hemoglobin category only (5).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,1
Because postchallenge glucose is associated with prognosis (23) our data confirm the findings by Woerle et al. (24) that OGTT will help to identify subjects with increased cardiovascular risk.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Some limitations pertain to our study.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Considering the racial and ethnic differences in the glycated hemoglobin concentration our findings are restricted to whites (25).,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Furthermore the LURIC participants have been recruited at a tertiary referral center and underwent coronary angiography; therefore the results may not be representative of a random population sample.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
However the aim of this work was to specifically address the question whether glycated hemoglobin was a significant and independent predictor of mortality in subjects with elevated cardiovascular risk.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Because this study was observational in design we are not able to prove causality either.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
In addition the number of participants in the subgroup with the lowest glycated hemoglobin values was not very large.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
This may account for the nonsignificant association of lownormal glycemic state with mortality.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Nevertheless the number of participants in the highest glycated hemoglobin category was even smaller compared with the lowest category and a high level of significance was achieved by analyzing the mortality data for this subgroup.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Another aspect to be mentioned is that glycated hemoglobin was only measured once at baseline.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Hence we were not able to control for possible alterations of glycated hemoglobin during the follow-up.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
Finally the questionnaire used to estimate physical activity has not been stringently validated.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
The major strengths of the LURIC cohort are the precise clinical and metabolic characterization of the participants including the availability of coronary angiograms its cross-sectional and prospective design and the completeness of the follow-up.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
In conclusion we found that glycated hemoglobin significantly and independently of fasting glucose predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals who underwent coronary angiography.,Silbernagel 2011.txt,0
However in an analysis of 14 European cohorts by the DECODE group hazard ratios for CVD death associated with IGT and/or IFG were lower after 10 years of follow-up compared with 5 years of It is possible that in studies with longer follow-up a high proportion of individuals with IGT at baseline develop diabetes as an intermediate condition before onset of CHD or death.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
However mean fasting glucose was similar in excluded subjects compared with those not excluded and the magnitude of association between fasting glucose and all-cause mortality or incident CHD was similar in the two groups suggesting that the results are representative for all subjects in the cohort without CVD and diabetes.,Pankow_2007.txt,0
Possible differences in the etiology and long-term risk associated with IFG and IGT are important to delineate in light of the population impact of CVD morbidity and mortality and inconsistent use of the OGTT in clinical settings.,Pankow_2007.txt,0

First the measurement of waist circumference was not commonly performed in the OGHMA screening in 1997.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Therefore metabolic syndrome was defined based on the modified criteria of the ATP III in which BMI (≥ 25 kg/m 2 ) was substituted for the waist circumference measurement.,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
Both waist circumference and BMI are accurate predictors of total body fat however in the Asian population (40).,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Furthermore the present study suggests that the modified ATP III criteria are useful for detecting the risk for developing CKD.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Second a selection bias of subjects might exist.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Our subjects were able to pay the fee to participate in the screening program and they were mainly employees of local companies.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
This might be one reason why more men than women participated.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Also some baseline characteristics were different between the subjects that were followed and those that dropped out.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Third serum creatinine levels and calculated GFR have been used to define CKD (17).,Tozawa 2007.txt,1
Although inulin or iothalamate clearance techniques might provide a more sensitive estimate of renal function serum creatinine is widely used in large epidemiologic studies and clinical practice for estimating renal function.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Therefore our findings are applicable to clinical and public health practice settings.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
We chose estimated GFR calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula which is more accurate for predicting GFR than is measuring the creatinine clearance or other commonly used equations (16).,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Fourth in the present study we did not measure the reproducibility of proteinuria and GFR because only one set of data for proteinuria and GFR were available at each examination.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Fifth the possible effect of hypertension or diabetes mellitus developed during the follow-up period on the development of CKD could not be excluded in the present study.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
In summary we investigated the effects of metabolic syndrome on the incidence of CKD in a large screened cohort of Japanese.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Metabolic syndrome was an independent predictor for developing CKD.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
Early detection and treatment of those with metabolic syndrome are essential as continuing strategies to prevent CKD.,Tozawa 2007.txt,0
The present study highlighted sex differences in the role of impaired fasting glucose in recurrent cardiovascular events in a community-based cohort of survivors of a first acute myocardial infarction.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Specifically the principle finding of this report is that impaired fasting glucose defined as fasting plasma glucose between 100 mg/dl and 125 mg/dl was a predictor of recurrent CVD only among women imparting a multivariate hazard ratio of 2.24.,Donahue 2011.txt,1
Neither IFG nor diabetes was independently related to risk of recurrence in men.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
The Worcester Heart Attack Study has followed survivors of AMI for up to ten years and reported no sex difference for total mortality 12.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
The SPRINT study suggested that among those who took insulin for their diabetes women had poorer survival than men; an observation not seen among users of oral hypoglycemic agents 13.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
In the primary CVD prevention setting a few studies point to potential sex differences in the association of impaired fasting glucose with cardiovascular risk.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
For example recent findings from the Framingham Offspring cohort study showed that both the 1997 and 2003 IFG definitions were predictive of CHD in women but not men 5.,Donahue 2011.txt,1
In agreement with this a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 1999-2004 showed that compared to normoglycemic subjects women with IFG (100-125 mg/dl) had a significant 83% increased 10-year risk of developing CHD whereas no significant risk was observed in men6.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Several mechanisms may be involved to help explain these results.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
For example women with impaired fasting glucose may have a greater degree of insulin resistance and/or have greater endothelial dysfunction14  15.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Unfortunately we did not have the necessary clinical information to examine these possibilities.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Diabetic women may also have experienced greater left ventricular dysfunction than their male counterparts 20 although there were few differences in cardiac enzyme levels post MI (data not shown).,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Furthermore in the present study men with IFG were more healthy and lean than women with IFG.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
This could explain at least in part the observed sex differences in the effect of IFG on recurrent CVD.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
In the past treatment guidelines have tended to focus on optimal glycemic control in the diabetic patients.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Recent findings from three clinical trials have shown however that glycemic control is not strongly related to risk of first MI 16 -18 .,Donahue 2011.txt,0
The prevention of CVD disease may be more strongly related to treatment of conventional CVD risk factors as well as nonglycemic factors and influenced not only by the management of glycemic control but also aggressive management of the conventional coronary risk factors including enhancing insulin sensitivity 19.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
In this observational study pharmacologic therapy was quite common making it very difficult to tease out a unique contribution of a specific drug to risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We have shown in previous work that women who progressed from normoglycemia to impaired fasting glucose had evidence of greater endothelial dysfunction than their male counterparts 15 and had a higher index of insulin resistance consistent with findings from the WISE study 20.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Whether this also extends into the post MI period deserves further epidemiologic scrutiny.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We also did not have data concerning in-hospital MI characteristics such as new Q wave anterior vs. posterior MI ST vs. non-ST elevation heart failure or cardiogenic shock.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
These variables likely reflect the degree of damage to left ventricular function and risk for ventricular arrhythmia and it is unclear how they would have affected our findings.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Some limitations of this investigation deserve comment.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We limited our study population to those aged 35 to 69 years who were discharged alive from the hospital.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Thus those of both genders at highest risk for AMI and diabetes were not included.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Our results therefore may not be applicable to this group of patients.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We did not collect data on in-hospital mortality as the focus of our research was on secondary prevention post-discharge.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We also had largely a white male and somewhat more highly educated group of participants than nonparticipants which would limit the external but not internal validity of our findings.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
The Finnish contribution to the MONICA study 21 showed that diabetic men had a higher out-of-hospital mortality rate than did women but that diabetic women who survived to admission had a higher in-hospital and one year case-fatality rate than their male counterparts.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Many studies have shown a greater case-fatality rate in women with AMI than men that persists during the first year of discharge 22.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
However restricting our study to patients who survived at least 28 days post-discharge could involve an underestimation of effects of diabetes in men who died early.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Thus we cannot totally dismiss the possibility that men with IFG died earlier than women with IFG.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Our finding of a sex difference related to impaired fasting glucose over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years is unique and suggests that risk of recurrent CVD in women post-MI extends below the diabetic range.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
However a longer follow-up period is needed to firmly establish this finding.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We had no information on time-dependent covariates as we conducted a single clinical exam.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
It is difficult to speculate with any reasonable degree of certainty on how for instance change in medication or dose might have affected our results.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Notable strengths of this study include the community-based nature of the investigation the recency of the past few years results which may reflect the current profiles of patients with AMI in this catchment area the careful assessment of risk factors the collection of pharmaceutical medications the standardization of the endpoints the number of events and the completeness of follow-up.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Our response rate of 60% is consistent with other large epidemiologic studies including the Atherosclerosis in Community Study (ARIC) 23 and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) 24 where response rates varied from 48% to 60%.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
The response rate would be unlikely to affect the internal validity of this study in any event.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
A strong survivorship bias would seem an unlikely explanation to completely explain the observed sex-differences in the current investigation.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
For example if women with diabetes were more likely to die during hospitalization than non-diabetic women this would tend to bias the hazard rate towards the null.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Indeed the median survivorship was 3.49 years in women and 3.73 years in men.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
There are no comparable data that we know of for women with impaired fasting glucose but a similar direction of attenuation seems plausible.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Longer term data are necessary to better address this question.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
We had information from one baseline examination which was not repeated during the follow-up time.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Thus we could not directly examine the proportion of impaired fasting glucose women who may have progressed to develop type 2 diabetes.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Some of the study participants classified as IFG case patients at the follow-up examination may have had undetected type 2 diabetes.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Such misclassification of diabetes would tend to increase the hazard ratio.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
"However fasting glucose measures are more highly correlated over time than the 2-h post-challenge glucose level and upon repeat testing many with newly detected type 2 diabetes are found to ""revert"" to either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or normal 25 -28.",Donahue 2011.txt,0
"The Hoorn Study 25 has reported that the risk for conversion to diabetes over 6.5 years is nearly identical among those with impaired fasting glucose (51.4/1,000 person-years) and those with impaired glucose tolerance (57.9/1,000 person-years).",Donahue 2011.txt,0
Thus we would expect relatively few women to progress to type 2 diabetes over our follow-up time especially because they are under care from their physician.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
There is abundant evidence that indicates that women patients with AMI do not receive the same standard of care as men.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
In patients admitted to 37 Minnesota hospitals women were less likely than men to receive beta-blockers aspirin and thrombolytic therapy 29.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
A similar pattern was noted in the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project 30.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Although we noted different disparities consideration of these variables in multivariate analyses did not materially alter our results (data not shown).,Donahue 2011.txt,0
In summary impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes were found to be significant predictors of recurrent CVD in women MI survivors after consideration of other risk factors and medical management.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
These results suggest that this increased CVD risk in these AMI survivors begins at lower levels of fasting glucose than are currently used to define type 2 diabetes.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Recent findings from the ACCORD VADT and ADVANCE16 -18 randomized clinical trials clearly show that tight glycemic control does not eliminate the risk of macrovascular complications in the diabetic population.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
Targeted screening of conventional CVD risk factors and secondary interventions proven to enhance insulin sensitivity should be more heavily emphasized and managed particularly among women.,Donahue 2011.txt,0
.007 Other type HTN med use past 30 days,Donahue 2011.txt,0
In this general population-based prospective study we found that both diabetes and IFG are associated with a substantial increased risk of all-cause mortality in Chinese adults.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Compared with those with NFG all-cause mortality risk in those with diabetes increased two and half times.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Furthermore there was a *80 % increased mortality from all causes among those with IFG.,Shi 2016.txt,0
We also detected an interaction between diabetes and vegetable-rich dietary pattern in relation to mortality.,Shi 2016.txt,0
In those with diabetes who had a low intake of vegetable-rich pattern had an increased risk of mortality compared to those who had a high intake of the pattern.,Shi 2016.txt,0
However overweight and residence (urban/ rural) were not associated with any increase in risk of mortality for those with diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
"A two to three times excess risk of mortality has often been found among those with diabetes as compared with those without diabetes [10,16].",Shi 2016.txt,0
Reductions in all-cause mortality among those with diabetes have occurred over time [26].,Shi 2016.txt,0
The latest data from Sweden suggest that the overall excess risk of death had dropped to a historically low level of 15 % [8].,Shi 2016.txt,0
In the Da Qing Study the ageadjusted relative risk of death from all causes in those with diabetes was three times higher compared with those without diabetes [16].,Shi 2016.txt,0
However the Da Qing study started in 1980s and over the past three decades there has been substantial development in the primary and secondary prevention of diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Surprisingly the excess risk of mortality in our study remained as high as 2.69 times.,Shi 2016.txt,0
It may underline the poor control of glycaemic level [3] as well as other risk factors among persons with diabetes in China.,Shi 2016.txt,0
In our study the prevalence of smoking was similar to the national average [27].,Shi 2016.txt,0
A very low proportion of patients reported undertaking leisure time physical activity.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Furthermore the consumption of refined wheat rice was high.,Shi 2016.txt,0
In the IFG and diabetes groups the raw rice consumption was 117 and 106 g per 1000 kcal respectively.,Shi 2016.txt,0
These unhealthy lifestyles may lead to the poor control of glycaemic level and contribute to a high proportion of mortality among people with IFG/diabetes in China.,Shi 2016.txt,0
The interaction between diabetes and income suggests that those in the disadvantaged population should be given priority for intervention.,Shi 2016.txt,0
The interaction between diabetes and vegetable-rich dietary pattern is consistent with current knowledge about the beneficial effects of fruit vegetable and whole grain.,Shi 2016.txt,0
The pattern is inversely associated with rice intake.,Shi 2016.txt,0
It is also consistent with current knowledge about the relationship between rice intake and diabetes [17].,Shi 2016.txt,0
Rice has a high glycaemic index and has previously been found to be associated with an increased risk of hyperglycaemia in the cohort [18].,Shi 2016.txt,0
In general a diet with a high glycaemic index impairs glycaemic control.,Shi 2016.txt,0
It has been shown that poor glycaemic control increases the risk of mortality [8].,Shi 2016.txt,1
Overall our study suggests a beneficial effect of engaging in physical activity and a high intake of vegetable-rich dietary pattern among those with diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Because the prevalence of favourable lifestyle factors in the population is low there appears an opportunity that lifestyle modification will be able to reduce a substantial number of premature deaths among those with diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Several limitations in our study should be acknowledged.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Firstly although we had 5-year follow-up due to the high attrition rate we decided not to incorporate the data at follow-up.,Shi 2016.txt,0
During a 5-year follow-up 125 developed IFG/diabetes among 1056 participants with NFG at baseline.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Therefore our study may underestimate the risk of mortality among those with diabetes or IFG.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Secondly due to the small number of deaths we could not further analyse mortality due to specific CVD outcomes due to lack of statistical power.,Shi 2016.txt,0
We also note that the number of deaths among those with diabetes was low and this has led to some uncertainty in our findings especially for CVD mortality.,Shi 2016.txt,0
However despite this the magnitude of the HR of diabetes for all-cause and CVD mortality is in line with several well-established studies suggesting that our results are not likely to be due to chance.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Education was positively with the intake of vegetable-rich dietary pattern in the sample but income was inversely associated with vegetable-rich dietary pattern (data not shown).,Shi 2016.txt,0
Thus the interaction between vegetablerich dietary pattern and IFG/diabetes could be confounded by socioeconomic status.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Although we have adjusted for education and income in the multivariable model residual confounding is still possible.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Furthermore dietary intake was not continuously measured during follow-up.,Shi 2016.txt,0
The eating habits could change during the ten-year period.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Finally in our study diabetes was based on fasting glucose and selfreported known diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
It is known that the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is high in China.,Shi 2016.txt,0
underestimation of the prevalence of diabetes is highly likely and this may affect the outcomes of the study.,Shi 2016.txt,0
The strength of the study is the face-to-face-based interview by well-trained health workers at baseline as well as the use of 3-day WFR to measure energy and nutrients intake.,Shi 2016.txt,0
The study included both urban and rural participants.,Shi 2016.txt,0
It can be generalized in the study population to the province with over 70 million residents.,Shi 2016.txt,0
However whether the findings can be generalized in the whole Chinese population is not clear.,Shi 2016.txt,0
In conclusion diabetes and IFG are associated with an increased risk of death in Chinese adults.,Shi 2016.txt,0
A high intake of vegetable-rich dietary pattern is associated with decreased risk of mortality for those with diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
There is no interaction between the rice-based traditional dietary pattern and IFG/diabetes.,Shi 2016.txt,0
Hazard Ratio 2,Shi 2016.txt,0
The primary findings from this large national populationbased cohort study indicate that after adjustment for the traditional CVD risk factors the 5-year mortality from all causes was significantly greater for KDM IFG and IGT than for NGT.,Barr_2007.txt,1
The risk of CVD mortality was also significantly greater for those with KDM and IFG not IGT compared with NGT.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"The DECODE and DECODA meta-analyses compared the IFG group with people IFG whereas the comparison group in the present study consisted of people who had both ""normal"" FPG (Ͻ6.1 mmol/L) and 2-hour PG (Ͻ7.8 mmol/L) values which allowed better discrimination of mortality risk between those with IFG and NGT.",Barr_2007.txt,0
In contrast with the findings from DECODE 9 DECODA 10 and Coutinho et al 13 that showed a significant positive   between IGT and CVD mortality we found that IGT was only a significant predictor for all-cause mortality not for CVD mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
Although our ability to investigate the specific non-CVD causes of death was limited by inadequate sample size it is possible to infer that in the present study cohort IGT may increase the risk of cancer mortality because the underlying cause for the majority (59.3%) of non-CVD deaths was attributable to malignant neoplasm.,Barr_2007.txt,0
The differences between responders and nonresponders indicate that the cohort may not have been fully representative of Australian adults; however these differences are to affect the strength of the relationships between glucose tolerance categories and mortality.,Barr_2007.txt,0
"In end-stage renal disease patients protein-energy wasting and inflammation contribute to elevated mortality and underpin the direct association observed between BMI and survival [29,30].",Ma_2012.txt,0
First it can clearly identify the timing of the findings according to a Seung Hyun Ma et al. population based prospective cohort and indicates a decreased possibility of bias resulting in potential confounding variables due to memory according to the survey data.,Ma_2012.txt,0
"""In this prospective study on new-onset CAD patients undergoing coronary angiography we interestingly found that pre-DM was not associated with an increased CVD risk and had a similar risk with subjects with NGR.",Liu 2018.txt,1
However when it occurred in the hypertensive subjects defined by either JNC-7 or 2017 ACC/AHA criteria the risk for more severe coronary lesions was significantly elevated compared with that for participants with normal plasma glucose and normal BP.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Meanwhile under the diagnostic criteria of JNC-7 the risk for CVD events of pre-DM combined with hypertension was increased by 1.58-fold compared with normoglycemic and normotensive participants.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Moreover when hypertension was diagnosed according to the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria the risk of pre-DM plus hypertension for CVD events was significantly increased by 2.37-fold.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Our results may provide new information and evidence for the relation of pre-DM status to severity and clinical prognosis of patients with stable new-onset CAD.,Liu 2018.txt,0
DM is a most important and common metabolic disease with an increasing morbidity worldwide.,Liu 2018.txt,1
8 It represents a public health problem of epidemic proportions in both developed and developing countries.,Liu 2018.txt,1
14 Whats more it is well determined that DM increases morbidity and mortality of CAD which is the leading cause of death worldwide.,Liu 2018.txt,0
9,Liu 2018.txt,0
The most important risk factor for DM is a condition called pre-DM which is generally defined as IFG impaired glucose tolerance or both.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Later elevated HbA1c which integrates plasma glucose over time is promoted as another indicator of pre-DM.,Liu 2018.txt,1
1,Liu 2018.txt,0
The predisposition of pre-DM to DM makes it a potential risk factor for CVD as well.,Liu 2018.txt,0
8 The prevalence of pre-DM in the United States had increased to an estimated rate of 36.2% in 2010.,Liu 2018.txt,0
3 Meanwhile as noted in a report in 2017 by Wang et al 4 ≈35.7% of the adults had pre-DM in China and the incidence rate was as high as 50.1% in another report.,Liu 2018.txt,0
15 Because of the high and widespread prevalence of pre-DM ongoing debate is whether pre-DM is an independent risk factor of CVD and whether it deserves targeted identification and clinical intervention.,Liu 2018.txt,0
"Several studies indicated that dysglycemia within nondiabetic glucose range was associated with increased risk for CVD. 5,[16][17][18]",Liu 2018.txt,1
"However recently a systematic review 10 and 3 meta-analysis 10,19 showed that pre-DM were only associated with a modest increase in the risk for CVD.",Liu 2018.txt,0
Moreover the first wave of the Nord-Trondelag Health Study concluded that DM but not hyperglycemia below the current diagnostic threshold for DM had a significantly higher risk for fatal CAD in both genders.,Liu 2018.txt,1
9 Another large cohort study in Korea reported that the increased risk for myocardial infarction could not be observed in the IFG population and only be observed in the diabetic glucose level.,Liu 2018.txt,0
20 Furthermore Liu et al 7 and Qiu et al 6 indicated that pre-DM per se did not increase the CVD risk and was associated with it only when combined with other metabolic disorders.,Liu 2018.txt,0
In our study pre-DM was defined by an elevation of fasting plasma glucose 2-hour glucose or HbA1c levels.,Liu 2018.txt,1
"We also did not find an association between pre-DM alone and the severity and outcomes of stable new-onset CAD which provide more evidence for the lack of correlation between pre-DM and CVD risk.""",Liu 2018.txt,0
"""Hypertension is another significant metabolic disease with powerful risk for CVD and is present in up to two-thirds of DM patients.",Liu 2018.txt,1
21,Liu 2018.txt,0
It has much in common with DM such as caused by unhealthy lifestyles associated with insulin resistance and leading to similar complications.,Liu 2018.txt,1
22 Similarly pre-DM also aggregates commonly with other CVD risk factors.,Liu 2018.txt,0
8 In this study the prevalence of hypertension defined according to the JNC-7 criteria in NGR pre-DM and DM was 56.7% 59.9% and 71.6% respectively.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Meanwhile when diagnosed by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline it was 79.7% 80.8% and 88.1% in the 3 groups respectively.,Liu 2018.txt,1
The population with DM had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension than other 2 groups while the difference between pre-DM and NGR group was not significant.,Liu 2018.txt,0
The relative higher coexistence of DM and hypertension compared with previous studies and the small difference of the prevalence of hypertension between subjects with pre-DM and NGR may both be ascribed to our CAD population which is different from the general population.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Meanwhile close to 20% patients in our study population had newly diagnosed hypertension according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline which was higher than the 13.7% reported in the guideline.,Liu 2018.txt,1
The reason may be that patients with CAD have higher BP than the general population.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Whats more it has been well demonstrated that the coexistence of DM and hypertension certainly increased the risk of CVD and other complications regardless of the country.,Liu 2018.txt,0
22 However studies on whether pre-DM carries any additional CVD risk in patients with hypertension or acts as an additional CVD risk independently of hypertension are insufficient and rare.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Qiu et al 6 demonstrated that pre-DM only when associated with hypertension would significantly elevate CVD risk.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Zhang et al 11 found that there was no difference in the rate of incident CVD among normotensive participants with NGR IFG or impaired glucose tolerance while IFG or impaired glucose tolerance plus prehypertension greatly increased the CVD risk.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Up to now there have been no studies to affirm the effects of hypertension on the association between pre-DM and CVD risk including coronary severity and clinical outcomes in patients with stable new-onset CAD.,Liu 2018.txt,0
The current analysis indicated that compared with participants with NGR and normal BP those with pre-DM alone had no significant increase of risk for coronary severity and CVD events while pre-DM plus hypertension significantly elevated CVD risk.,Liu 2018.txt,0
The results not only enhance our understanding of the role of pre-DM in the CAD population but also provide guidance for future prevention and treatment of patients with CAD.,Liu 2018.txt,0
In addition hypertension as is well established increased coronary severity significantly either alone or concurrent with pre-DM.,Liu 2018.txt,1
Hypertension alone also had a higher HR for CVD events than pre-DM alone though not reaching a statistical significance.,Liu 2018.txt,0
"Therefore among patients with pre-DM and hypertension clinicians may need to focus more on tight BP control.""",Liu 2018.txt,0
Why does pre-DM combined with hypertension but not pre-DM alone increase the cardiovascular risk?,Liu 2018.txt,0
"To the best of our knowledge hypertension damages endothelial function through hemodynamic changes leading to endothelial dysfunction 21,23,24 increased oxidative stress 24 and serum levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 (interleukin-6) and TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α) and upregulated expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and P-selectin.",Liu 2018.txt,1
23,Liu 2018.txt,0
These effects are the key initiator for arteriosclerosis thrombosis and their complications.,Liu 2018.txt,0
"21,23 Besides hypertension dysglycemia is the second most common risk factor for endothelial dysfunction oxidative stress and inflammation.",Liu 2018.txt,1
Thus high BP and IGR have similar mechanisms to increase CVD risk and it seems to be reasonable that pre-DM and hypertension together would have higher risk for CVD than either one alone.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Moreover it has been demonstrated by Huang et al 23 that patients with both hypertension and pre-DM showed significantly higher levels of ICAM-1 and TNF-α compared with the subjects with hypertension alone suggesting that the comorbidity of these diseases may aggravate endothelial dysfunction and inflammation by promoting the expression of ICAM-1 and TNF-α and thus increase the CVD risk.,Liu 2018.txt,0
In this study we compared inflammation markers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein fibrinogen and ESR between different categories according to DM status or both DM and hypertension status.,Liu 2018.txt,0
It is not surprising that pre-DM combined with hypertension had significantly higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein fibrinogen and ESR than pre-DM alone or hypertension alone (data not shown) which lend support to the above explanation.,Liu 2018.txt,0
In short the coexistence of hypertension and DM or pre-DM may combine to multiply the risk of inciting endothelial damage and then increase the risk for adverse CVD events through multiple mechanisms which need more studies to further clarify in future.,Liu 2018.txt,0
"""As for the strengths our study is the first studying the impact of hypertension on the association between pre-DM and CVD risk including coronary severity and clinical outcomes in patients with angiography-proven stable new-onset CAD.",Liu 2018.txt,0
Moreover our participants were from a homogeneous population and had no intervention during the visit which would be good enough to reflect humans natural development of disease.,Liu 2018.txt,0
"Last but not least considering the recent publication of 2017 ACC/AHA guideline we added the new definition criterion of hypertension into our analysis.""",Liu 2018.txt,1
However our study is limited by several facts: first as inherent to the nature of any observational and prospective study our findings are subject to confounding factors and also the level of risk factors at baseline examination might change during the follow up.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Second the follow-up time and sample size in this study needed to be longer and larger to examine the prognostic value of pre-DM alone or plus hypertension in the long-term outcomes.,Liu 2018.txt,0
Third this is a study in Chinese patients with established CAD which may limit the generalizability of our findings.,Liu 2018.txt,0
However it is likely applicable to the many populations in China and around the world because of the high incidence of CAD.],Liu 2018.txt,0

Low-risk was defined as all of no smoking BMI < 25.0 kg/m 2  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at least one-half hour per day; score in the highest 40% of the cohort for diet high in cereal fiber marine omega-3 fatty acids folate polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio low in trans fatty acids and glycemic load and average alcohol intake of at last half a drink per day.,Palmieri 2006.txt,1

Along with declines in physical activity of work and leisure the serially more unfavorable eating patterns account also for increasing overweight/obesity.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
In these regards it is relevant also to note recent research advances on relations of multiple dietary factors to blood pressure: data from several epidemiologic studies and from the well controlled DASH and OMNIHEART feeding trials indicate that multiple dietary factorsmacronutrients and micronutrients electrolytes (NaCl K)-influence blood pressure as well as caloric imbalance (overweight/obesity) and excess alcohol intake [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28].,Palmieri 2006.txt,0

The limitations of the present study include the small size of low-risk sub-cohorts (male female); the concordant results on CHD here and for the six low-risk cohorts similarly defined (MRFIT Chicago) however support the inference that low risk as defined protects generally against CHD an inference given further support by the concordant results from the Nurses Health Study with low risk defined by favorable lifestyle traits [5].,Palmieri 2006.txt,1
A further limitation is that low-risk status is based on only one measurement of the risk factors; this limitation the regression dilution bias problem [30] however leads to some people being improperly designated low risk with resultant underestimation of the favorable effects of low risk.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Furthermore there are no data on eating drinking or exercise lifestyle traits implicated as important CVD risk factors; the lack of data on these traits however makes more impressive the benefit against CHD with favorable levels of readily measured modifiable major risk factors and again it is relevant to note the concordant findings from the Nurses Health Study with low risk defined based on multiple lifestyle criteria.,Palmieri 2006.txt,1
That only 10-year follow-up data were obtained is another limitation; favorable findings for low risk and CHD prevailed for the Nurses MRFIT and Chicago cohorts however with 14 25 and 30-year followup [1][2][3][4][5].,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Finally the participation rate was from 40-78%; risk factor average levels and distributions were similar however across all 12 samples and like those for samples in other European countries in the 1980s-1990s.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
In conclusion low risk favorable levels of all readily measured modifiable major CVD risk factors is associated with low CHD rates.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
Low prevalence rates of low risk in contemporary populations are products of adverse lifestyles all amenable to prevention and control including smoking adverse eating and drinking patterns sedentary habit causing commonality of elevated blood pressure hyperglycemia/diabetes dyslipidemia obesity.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0

The priority strategic aim is to increase progressively the proportion of the population at low risk at all ages and this is key to ending the CHD/CVD epidemic.,Palmieri 2006.txt,0
The present study demonstrates that although both 1 and 2 h post-load glucose levels significantly correlated with higher HbA1 concentrations the 1 h level was invariably higher across HbA1 quintiles within the non-diabetic range.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
This observation is consistent with and extends previous findings relating elevations in 1 h post-load levels with progression to prediabetes and diabetes [13][14][15].,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The incremental increase in the 1 h glucose levels may explain the progressive elevation in HbA1 quintiles as the 2 h glucose levels changed minimally.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
This observation suggests that the standard 2 h OGTT may therefore underestimate the severity of glucose especially at lower HbA1 concentrations.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Elevated 2 h glucose levels even within the normal range occur considerably late in the evolution to diabetes [16] thereby delaying an opportunity for earlier diagnosis and intervention.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Furthermore as HbA 1c  categorized in the general population according to <5.7 5.7-6.4 and ≥ 6.5% is insensitive and has poor positive predictive value for diagnosing diabetes compared with the fasting plasma glucose [17]; the 1 h postprandial glucose level may identify those at risk before progression occurs.,Bergman 2015.txt,1
Therefore those at risk should therefore preferably be diagnosed with the OGTT [18] as it is more predictive for diagnosing glucose abnormalities than the FPG alone.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The early diagnosis of dysglycemic conditions could be facilitated by measuring the 1 h rather than the 2 h post-load glucose level.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
In this study differences between the 1 and 2 h glucose levels were consistently highly significant (p < 0.001) in the total group stratifying by HbA1 quintiles and according to glycemic status.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The elevation in the 1 and 2 h glucose levels were significantly higher in individuals with IFG/IGT compared with the IFG group.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The 1 h rather than the 2 h glucose levels would identify individuals with IGT within the normoglycemic and IFG groups and those with diabetes in the IFG/IGT group.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The fifth HbA1 quintile ranging from 7.8 to 11.0% corresponded to a mean 1 h glucose level of 150.4 mg/ dL (8.4 mmol/L) comparable to previous observations [13][14][15] suggesting that a 1 h value exceeding 155 mg/dL (8.61 mmol/L) increases considerably the risk for developing diabetes.,Bergman 2015.txt,1
Insulin concentrations also increased progressively with worsening glycemic status.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Fasting insulin levels while not different between the IFG and IFG/IGT groups differed significantly from the normoglycemic group.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The 1 and 2 h insulin levels in the IFG/IGT group were also significantly higher than in the IFG group.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Whereas the 2 h insulin level continued to increase in the IFG/IGT group compared with the 1 h level the IFG group demonstrated a decline in the 2 h insulin level likely related to the relative absence of peripheral insulin resistance described in this population [19][20][21].,Bergman 2015.txt,0
A highly significant association between the upper quintile of HbA1 compared with the lower four quintiles and time to death was observed that persisted when adjusting for sex but gradually declined when further adjustments were made for age smoking BMI and blood pressure.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Adjusting for the previous parameters and the glycemic group the fifth quintile of the HbA1 exhibited a 15% increased HR for mortality compared with the lower four quintiles.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
In addition the IGT and IGT/IFG groups conferred a 36% greater mortality risk than the normoglycemic group.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The latter observation is consistent with those of Selvin et al. who found that glycated haemoglobin levels especially at values above 6.0% were associated with an increased risk of diabetes and CVD and death from any cause compared with fasting glucose [22].,Bergman 2015.txt,1
Unwin et al. also observed that HbA 1c levels were continuously and positively associated with CVD and total mortality independent of CVD risk factors [1].,Bergman 2015.txt,0

Individuals with IFG/IGT and diabetes corresponding to higher HbA1 quintiles had a significantly higher mortality risk than those with normoglycemia.,Bergman 2015.txt,0

Some limitations must be addressed in relation to this study.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Principally HbA 1c measurements were substituted with HbA1.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Although the absolute value of HbA1 in the present study may not be currently clinically relevant this does not alter our findings regarding inter-relationships of the various biomarkers as well as associations to mortality.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
The glycemic measurements in the study were obtained crosssectionally allowing association testing only.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
A potential source of bias stems from the fact that although the original samples were obtained in a systematic stratified manner from the study population the group studied may not be strictly representative.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
However the distribution of participants undergoing OGTT was not statistically different from that of the original sample with respect to age sex and ethnic origin.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Finally participants underwent an OGTT after an overnight fast with a 100 g glucose instead of the standard 75 g. Nevertheless because the additional glucose load had little effect on the glucose level [9] but enhanced the insulin response [10] it was not expected to influence the use of the clinical threshold of 200 mg/dL for diabetes.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Identifying those at an early point in their evolution to worsening dysglycemia may therefore have the greatest benefit of preserving β-cell function and hence preventing or reversing an otherwise ineluctable decline towards diabetes and increased mortality.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Although further prospective studies will be required to confirm the present observations in the interim it may be prudent to include a 1 h glucose level during an OGTT to avoid underestimating the severity of glycemic disorders that may occur with sole usage of the 2 h post-load value.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Although the optimal method for screening and diagnosing glucose disorders has not been established the combination of HbA 1c plus fasting plasma glucose has been reported to improve identification of those at risk for progression to diabetes [29].,Bergman 2015.txt,0
Inclusion of the 1 h level may further refine our ability to identify high-risk individuals.,Bergman 2015.txt,0
"For example of the eighteen studies that used the same ADA criterion as current study the two studies with the highest weights were based on men 40 to 59 years of age and men and women 30 to 89 years of age (mean about 53 years) respectively [30,31].",Deedwania_2013.txt,0

In the present study the cumulative incidence of CKD was significantly higher in the combination of high-normal BP/hypertension and IFG/DM group than in the combination of normotensive and NGT group which is consistent with the findings from previous studies.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Thus the results of the present study support the possibility that the combination of hypertension and hyperglycemia is important for preventing the development of CKD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Based on these findings hypertension and hyperglycemia not only alone but also in combination may be associated with the development of CKD ESRD and CVD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Hypertension and hyperglycemia have been thought to induce nephropathy a leading cause of microvascular complications through an increase in productions of oxidative stress inflammation advanced glycation end products,Michishita 2017.txt,1
The data are expressed as the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]).,Michishita 2017.txt,0
In this analysis the prevalence of high-normal blood pressure (BP)/hypertension and impaired fasting glucose (IFG)/diabetes mellitus (DM) at baseline was a dependent variable and the incidence of CKD was an independent variable.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
In the multivariable model age BMI eGFR and smoking and drinking habits at baseline were entered as adjusted factors.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
The abbreviations are the same as those in Figure 3.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
"The abbreviations are the same as those in Table 1. (AGE) and vascular endothelial dysfunction (34,35).",Michishita 2017.txt,0
Ogawa et al. (36) examined the blockade of angiotensin II type I receptors which reduces oxidative stress markers in parallel with urinary albumin and found that increases in oxidative stress caused by angiotensin II play an important role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Unfortunately we were unable to clarify the causality of the incidence of CKD and the combination of hypertension and hyperglycemia as the present study was performed within the constraints of a health checkup.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
However given these present and previous findings microvascular complications such as increases in production of oxidative stress inflammation AGE and vascular endothelial dysfunction may cause hypertension and/or hyperglycemia representing a possible mechanism underlying the association between the incidence of CKD and the combination of hypertension and hyperglycemia.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
On the other hand in the present study SBP DBP and rate of taking antihypertensive drugs were significantly higher in the CKD subjects with high-normal BP/hypertension than in the CKD subjects without high-normal BP/hypertension while fasting glucose HbA 1 c levels and rate of taking hypoglycemic agents were significantly higher in the CKD subjects with IFG/DM than in the CKD subjects without IFG/DM.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
From the current findings it was impossible to clarify the specific characteristics of nondiabetic and non-hypertensive CKD subjects.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Therefore we can envision that different mechanisms are responsible for the development of CKD in non-hypertensive or non-hyperglycemic subjects compared to hypertensive or hyperglycemic subjects.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
According to our data the cumulative incidence of CKD was similar in the high-normal BP and hypertensive groups and a similar tendency was also observed in the IFG and DM groups.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
"Elevations of BP and blood glucose levels are known to be major independent risk factors for the development of subsequent ESRD and CVD even in subjects with high-normal BP and/or IFG (31,(37)(38)(39)(40).",Michishita 2017.txt,1
A sub-analysis of the CASE-J trial (39) that examined the relationship between the achieved BP and incidence of CVD found that a high-normal BP was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with DM and CKD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Fox et al. (40) also reported that the odds ratio for developing CKD was significantly higher in subjects with IFG or impaired glucose tolerance and DM than in normal subjects and noted that prediabetes was an independent risk factor for the development of kidney disease.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Given these findings hypertension and hyperglycemia especially early stage of high-normal BP and IFG may be predictive factors for incidence of the CKD and may indirectly help prevent the development of ESRD or CVD or the introduction of dialysis in middle-aged and older males.,Michishita 2017.txt,1
Therefore we believe that administering lifestyle counseling to improve in early stage of hypertension and hyperglycemia is necessary to prevent the development of CKD ESRD and CVD.],Michishita 2017.txt,0
[There are several limitations associated with this study.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
First the limited study population resulted in a small number of male subjects who were predominantly middle-aged and older and did not have any health complications.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Thus there is potential selection bias in this study as our limited study population may have included more CKD subjects with slowly declining renal function than CKD subjects with rapid deterioration.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
As such whether or not our findings are generalizable to females patients with ESRD or those with other complications remains unclear.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Second although this study was performed within the constraints of the health checkup it was not possible to clarify the causality of the incidence of CKD with the combination of high-normal BP/hypertension and IFG/ DM.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Third the indices of glucose tolerance in this study were evaluated using the fasting glucose and HbA 1 c levels.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Impaired glucose tolerance as measured with an oral glucose tolerance test was associated with an increased risk of CVD compared with IFG (41) which could not be evaluated in our subjects.,Michishita 2017.txt,1
Fourth there were many dropout subjects (n = 80) with missing information over the previous 6 years who were eligible for the present study.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Age was significantly higher in the subjects without follow-up assessments than in the subjects with follow-up assessments (52.2 ± 6.7 years vs. 58.7 ± 4.2 years p = 0.021 data not shown).,Michishita 2017.txt,0
We considered that above reason was that there were many retired in subjects without follow-up assessments because this study was performed within the constraints of the health checkup in our university.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Finally we calculated the eGFR using the Japanese GFR inference formula (13) and used proteinuria as an index of the renal function.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
To fully clarify the influence of hypertension and hyperglycemia and the combination thereof on the renal function other indices of the renal function such as urinary protein excretion microalbuminuria or cystatin C should be simultaneously assessed.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
However we were unable to measure any additional markers of the renal function in this study.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
"However it is well known that hypertension and hyperglycemia play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various stages of renal dysfunction (34,35) and that they are closely correlated with the future development of CKD ESRD and CVD (31,(37)(38)(39)(40).",Michishita 2017.txt,1
Furthermore the serum creatinine level can be easily measured as part of a routine clinical evaluation.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
"In addition eGFR is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and is more useful for this purpose than the serum creatinine level (14,16).",Michishita 2017.txt,0
The results of the present study therefore show a relationship between hypertension and hyperglycemia and the combination thereof with the incidence of CKD and may support the hypothesis that the accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors leads to an increase in the incidence of CVD and the development of ESRD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Given our results we believe that performing early stage of lifestyle counseling to improve hypertension and hyperglycemia is necessary to prevent the development of CKD ESRD and CVD.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
Further investigations in a large number of subjects including subjects with other complications are necessary to more precisely clarify the mechanisms clinical implications and associations of several cardiovascular risk factors and their combination with the incidence of CKD following long-term intervention.,Michishita 2017.txt,0
"""The results of this study in a nationally representative cohort that followed individuals for 12 years confirm that the mortality risk of prediabetes is probably low.",Mainous 2014.txt,0
This is not unexpected based on the mixed results from previous studies several of which found either no future mortality risk or risk that was not robust across measures.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
However we found that the presence of TS and serum ferritin is associated with increased mortality risk of individuals with prediabetes.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Among individuals with normal iron levels those with prediabetes had low mortality risk levels similar to the adjusted risk of prediabetes alone.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
On the other hand in adjusted survival analyses individuals with prediabetes who also had elevated TS had substantially increased mortality risk.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
These findings extend previous work on iron markers and diabetes to the previously uninvestigated area of prediabetes.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
These results suggest that additional stratification of individuals with prediabetes on the basis of iron markers would be useful to identify those with higher risk and who might benefit from iron-lowering therapies.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Previous data have indicated that elevated iron markers are associated with the development of diabetes and that among individuals with diabetes the co-occurrence of elevated TS increases those patients mortality risk.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Early identification of individuals with both conditions ( prediabetes elevated iron) may help in slowing the development of diabetes as well as decreasing mortality risk.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
It is important for early identification of these individuals because much like individuals with prediabetes the vast majority of individuals with elevated iron do not know it.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
31,Mainous 2014.txt,0
These individuals need to be identified to mitigate the increased risk posed by elevated iron in combination with prediabetes.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Such individuals would be targets for intensive interventions to reduce risk including typical lifestyle interventions shown to help avoid the onset of diabetes in people at high risk.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
32 Although more research is needed into the ability of interventions on iron in prediabetes to affect development of diabetes and mortality risk some data suggest that reduction of TS improves HbA1c and glucose control.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
33,Mainous 2014.txt,0
These associations of TS and ferritin with mortality in the context of prediabetes are not surprising especially if elevations of these parameters are interpreted in light of current understanding of iron toxicity.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
34,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Iron whether absorbed as iron salts or in dietary haeme is processed by enterocytes and released into the plasma where it is transported in a non-reactive state bound to transferrin.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Iron that is bound to transferrin is in the Fe +3 state and is not reactive and therefore not toxic.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
However when TS is above 40-50% free iron or so-called non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) is released into the plasma as the buffering ability of transferrin is exceeded.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
35 Labile plasma iron (LPI) is a highly reactive subspecies of NTBI that interacts with hydrogen peroxide through Fenton chemistry to form the extremely powerful oxidants hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
These are the free radicals that ultimately directly damage protein and DNA.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Perhaps more importantly NTBI/LPI species are able to enter cells via ion channels.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
"These channels unlike the transferrin receptor are not regulated so this reactive iron freely enters the cytoplasm of the pancreas pituitary and heart.""",Mainous 2014.txt,0
The current results suggest that exposure to excessive free iron is dangerous in the context of prediabetes.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Furthermore elevated ferritin and TS predict poor diabetes control and phlebotomy to reduce iron even over short periods of time improve HbA1c in parallel with changes in TS even though ferritin is not changed.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
33 NTBI/LPI reflected by TS is the proximal cause of the toxicity.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Several strategies are available to decrease iron including chelation therapy and phlebotomy.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Phlebotomy is an easy inexpensive and well-tolerated intervention.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Reduction in TS by phlebotomy has been shown to improve measures of diabetic control.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
33 Furthermore correction of severe iron overload can significantly improve glucose tolerance.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
36,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Thus the finding that a baseline measure of high TS as point measure of toxicfree iron plus elevation of ferritin evidence of elevated cytosolic iron over a longer period of time predicts increased risk of mortality among individuals with prediabetes supports the premise that toxic-free iron is a health risk.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
The normoglycaemic group with elevated iron markers did not show increased mortality risk in comparison to the reference group of normoglycaemic and normal iron marker levels.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
This may seem inconsistent with other data on the increased mortality risk due to elevated TS by itself.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
However there is the potential that the effect of TS on mortality is modified by the presence of other variables.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
19 21 This effect has been shown in the past.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Rather than being inconsistent with the TS alone and mortality findings these new findings enhance our understanding of elevated iron markers and morbidity and mortality and allow us to consider the more complex but real situation of patients by considering multiple variables together rather than independently.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
This study has several limitations.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
First although we have a nationally representative population-based cohort followed through the National Death Index the biomarkers are measured only at baseline.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
There is the possibility that either the hyperglycaemia or elevated iron measures were identified and interventions were implemented to lower these biomarkers.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
If that were the case and a substantial number of individuals did drop their levels due to interventions thereby decreasing the potential mortality risk the observed adjusted risk individuals elevated at baseline is even more concerning.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Second we were only to follow these individuals for 12 years.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
It is possible that this time frame may have been too short to adequately see an effect for a biomarker like prediabetes.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
However we did censor the first 3 years of mortality so that any deaths in that time frame would not be attributed to prediabetes.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
The model still found a substantial mortality risk for the prediabetes plus iron markers in this length of time.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Third we were unable to evaluate the relationship between being elevated on both TS and serum ferritin with prediabetes on the risk of mortality.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
We attempted such an analysis but the number of individuals in the group with prediabetes and elevation on both iron markers was small and the population estimates were deemed unreliable.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
In conclusion this study representative of the population of the USA helps to clarify the current evidence on the mortality risk of prediabetes and provides further support for the role of elevated iron markers in health risk.,Mainous 2014.txt,0
Future screening and intervention programmes for prediabetes may benefit from additional strategies to recognise and treat iron elevations particularly TS.,Mainous 2014.txt,0

"In this large cohort of .370,000 individuals we confirm that HbA 1c is broadly linearly related to CVD risk in unadjusted analyses but that this association is substantially attenuated with adjustment for conventional CVD risk factors.",Welsh 2020.txt,0
Indeed in those with prediabetes while their unadjusted HR for CVD risk was 1.83 relative to those with normal HbA 1c  this fell to just 1.11 with adjustment for usual CVD risk factors.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
This means that while people with prediabetes on average have an ;80% greater CVD risk compared with those with normal HbA 1c levels such risk is largely driven not by elevated HbA 1c per se but rather by differences in the prevalence or levels of other established CVD risk factors: age blood pressure smoking lipid levels and BMI.,Welsh 2020.txt,1
Furthermore we show that addition of HbA 1c when the conventional risk factors are already accounted for does not meaningfully improve CVD risk prediction as shown by no gain in the NRI.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
In contrast the risk of CVD was meaningfully higher in those with diagnosed or undiagnosed baseline diabetes supporting the diagnostic cutoff for HbA 1c as it relates to CVD risk.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Our results add to existing literature by validating prior results published by the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) that demonstrated that while HbA 1c levels better predicted incident CVD events than fasting and postprandial glucose levels in those without prior diabetes or CVD the added predictive gain from inclusion of HbA 1c in risk prediction was modest.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The importance of Our results have practical implications for clinical practice.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
First these data are broadly supportive that HbA 1c should be used to diagnose prediabetes and new diabetes but also show that it is unlikely to be meaningfully additive for CVD risk prognostication in those without known diabetes.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Second all those found to have prediabetes on the basis of HbA 1c levels should have their CVD risk assessed by conventional methods i.e. with additional measurement of lipids and blood pressure as currently recommended (14) and it would not be appropriate to give only lifestyle advice to prevent or delay diabetes.,Welsh 2020.txt,1
Rather as those with prediabetes had higher baseline CVD risk with meaningfully higher mean SBP at just under 146 mmHg mean BMI just over 30 kg/m 2  and higher average total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratios they need comprehensive CVD risk management.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Finally given modest numbers with prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes (4% of cohort in total) the importance of using a non-laboratory test-based score first to identify those at highest risk for diabetes is reaffirmed.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
This means HbA 1c should only be measured in those with a high diabetes risk score as has been proposed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (15).,Welsh 2020.txt,0
We do however recognize that UK Biobank is not nationally representative but even so it is worth noting the relatively modest numbers with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
As with any study our work has strengths and limitations.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The current study is the largest single cohort reported to date to measure HbA 1c and assess CVD risk with standardized measurements across the cohort.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The limitations stem as noted above from UK Biobank cohort characteristicsda cohort somewhat healthier  than the average U.K. population.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The limitations also arise from lack of other glycemia measures although ERFC data have shown that HbA 1c is more strongly linked to CVD than is fasting glucose or 2-h glucose.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
Due to limited power we were also unable to examine whether associations of HbA 1c with outcomes were different by ethnicity.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
In conclusion in this very large wellphenotyped cohort with central laboratory assessment of HbA 1c  we show that HbA 1c minimally improves CVD risk prediction in patients without diabetes.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The same is also true for the subset with prediabetes.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The near twofold higher unadjusted risk for CVD in prediabetes is driven mainly by abnormal levels of conventional CVD risk factors.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
As such and as recommended (14) this group would benefit from lifestyle advice to prevent diabetes and from having all conventional CVD risk factors assessed and where relevant treated.,Welsh 2020.txt,0
The gray and black areas represent excessive incidence of CVD in the high blood glucose and pressure categories compared with the subjects with normoglycemia and blood pressure as a reference.,Kokubo_2010.txt,0

Our study clearly demonstrates that not only NDM but also IGT independently adversely affects prognosis after MI.,George 2015.txt,0
"This study confirms previous reports [1,16,27,29] that FPG alone underestimates the prevalence of abnormal glucometabolic state.",George 2015.txt,0
About 90% of our patients were diagnosed normal by FPG only and 84% of patients with AGT had normal FPG.,George 2015.txt,0
In the DECODE study about 37% of NDM diagnosed on OGTT were normal on FPG criteria [27].,George 2015.txt,1
In the GAMI population [1] 10% had NDM on FPG criteria compared to 31% on OGTT criteria.,George 2015.txt,1

"Glucometabolic abnormality seems to be overestimated within the first 24 hours after STEMI [19,29].",George 2015.txt,0
"However OGTT done at or after 5 days seems to reliably predict long term glucometabolic state [30,31].",George 2015.txt,0
This may be related to the subsidence of the acute responses between 2-5 days with no further decrease thereafter [31].,George 2015.txt,0
Hage et al [32] suggested a somewhat better reproducibility of OGTT in patients with subendocardial than transmural infarction.,George 2015.txt,0
All our patients had the OGTT at least three days (37% day 4) after the index event.,George 2015.txt,0
This makes it likely that the results would reliably predict long term glucometabolic state.,George 2015.txt,0
Irrespective of its relation to long term glucometabolic status pre-charge OGTT based classification independently predicted prognosis in our post-MI patients.,George 2015.txt,0
While the measurement of HbA1c would have improved the understanding of the glucometabolic status of these patients especially with regard to the role of stress induced hyperglycaemia in the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance; this was not available for use at our center on a routine basis.,George 2015.txt,0
Furthermore while HbA1c identifies patients with NDM it has limited use in the identification of patients with intermediate hyperglycaemia or IGT.,George 2015.txt,0
Recent studies have shown an increased incidence of adverse events in non-diabetic post MI patients with elevated HbA1c suggesting that the underlying mechanism is not entirely a stress mediated response [28].,George 2015.txt,0
Furthermore the purpose of the study was to ascertain the prognostic risk of post challenge hyperglycaemia in patients following acute MI irrespective of the underlying pathophysiology.,George 2015.txt,0
There are some differences in baseline characteristics across the three groups which could have influenced the results.,George 2015.txt,0
Patients with IGT and NDM were older than the patients in NGT group which was noted to be statistically significant.,George 2015.txt,0
Although we have adjusted for this in the cox proportional hazard regression model and while it is unlikely to explain the increased incidence of adverse events in the IGT and NDM group; it is difficult to be certain if there any residual confounding in the final result.,George 2015.txt,0
"Similar baseline variation especially in age between NGT and AGT has been noted in other similar studies as well [15,19].",George 2015.txt,0
The MACE rates in our study are similar to those previously reported [15][16][17]19].,George 2015.txt,0
"Contrary to some [16,17] our study suggests that clinical events rather non-target vessel revascularisation may predominate MACE in post-MI patients newly diagnosed with IGT or DM.",George 2015.txt,0

[Being an observational longitudinal cohort study using retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a single centre it has its limitations.,George 2015.txt,0
"In line with all other studies [4,[15][16][17] we did not explore the interaction between either acute revascularisation and post-challenge hyperglycaemia or post-discharge management of the glucometabolic status and prognosis.",George 2015.txt,0
As OGTT was not repeated pre-or post-discharge it is uncertain whether random fluctuation in glycaemia or stress associated hyperglycaemia affected results.,George 2015.txt,0
However as pre-discharge postchallenge hyperglycaemia irrespective of its pathophysiological mechanism diagnosed on these measurements predicted outcomes in post-MI patients the reproducibility of these measurements and its relation to long term glucometabolic status may be less relevant when assessing prognostic risk.,George 2015.txt,0
Though we could not include a small proportion of non-diabetic post-MI patients admitted to our institution who could not have OGTT for valid reasons we feel that it would be acceptable to extend the results of this study to the whole population.,George 2015.txt,0
In summary our study suggests for the first time that risk of MACE after an MI is increased not only in newly diagnosed DM but also in IGT.,George 2015.txt,0
It provides further evidence to support the previous finding that dysglycaemia is common post MI in patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus.,George 2015.txt,0
Importantly as the glucometabolic status of a large proportion of patients would be misdiagnosed on FPG only an appropriately timed OGTT after MI may be helpful in assessing prognostic risk and plan future management.,George 2015.txt,0
The results of this study show that subjects with prediabetes defined by IGT or HbA1 C level have an increased risk of incident CKD; however IFG was not associated with CKD.,Kim 2019.txt,1
Thus our findings indicate that IGT or HbA1C are predictors of CKD and might enable clinicians to better prevent the development of CKD in individuals with prediabetes potentially resulting in better outcomes.,Kim 2019.txt,0
We confirmed that both known and newly detected diabetes are strong prognostic factors in AMI.,Janszky 2009.txt,0

Heart failure or glucose abnormalities occurring separately and together are related to an increased morbidity and mortality but the combination of these disorders did not have a significant interaction effect.,Thrainsdottir 2005.txt,1

In the present large prospective Whitehall II cohort study of adults aged 50-80 years with simultaneous measures of different glycemic measures we found that of prediabetes defined by FPG and/or HbA 1c was three times higher when the ADA criteria were used than when the WHO/IEC definitions were used.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
Individuals with prediabetes defined by HbA 1c had substantially higher risk of CVD and mortality than those defined by the FPG or 2hPG criteria irrespective of whether the cut point of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) was used.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
For none of the glycemic measures did we find an inflection point for risk of CVD and mortality over the prediabetes range.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Furthermore the excess risk of CVD and death associated with having prediabetes was greatly reduced in HbA 1cdefined prediabetes and null in FPG-and 2hPG-defined prediabetes after adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
These findings indicate that there is no obvious optimal glycemic cutoff for risk stratification and the higher risk for CVD and death among individuals with prediabetes is mainly explained by its clustering with other risk factors Data are means (SD) or percentage (95% CI).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"WHO/IEC: normal glycemia FPG ,6.1 mmol/L and HbA 1c ,6.0% and for prediabetes by FPG only FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/L and HbA 1c ,6.0%; HbA 1c only HbA 1c ,6.0-6.4% and FPG ,6.1 mmol/L; and both FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/L and HbA 1c 6.0-6.4%.",Vistisen 2018.txt,1
"ADA: normal glycemia FPG ,5.6 mmol/L and HbA 1c ,5.7% and for prediabetes by FPG only FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and HbA 1c ,5.7%; HbA 1c only HbA 1c ,5.7-6.4% and FPG ,5.6 mmol/L; and both FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and HbA 1c 5.7-6.4%.",Vistisen 2018.txt,1

a Versus normal glycemia P  0.05. b Versus FPG only P  0.05. c Versus HbA 1c only P  0.05. associated with hyperglycemia.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
This challenges the use of the prediabetes classification as a stand-alone tool for risk stratification among older adults.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"Only a few previous studies have compared different definitions of prediabetes in relation to CVD and mortality in the same population (15,22).",Vistisen 2018.txt,1
Warren et al. (15) found in the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study that HbA 1c was more specific and provided better risk discriminating regarding future major events compared with FPG or 2hPG concentrations.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced but still significantly elevated in those with HbA 1cdefined prediabetes.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
However incidence rates for cardiovascular mortality became nonsignificantly elevated for all prediabetes subgroups after adjustment for  cardiovascular risk factors (15) which is in accordance with the findings from our analysis and underscores the importance of focusing on nonglycemic risk factors in individuals with prediabetes.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
In contrast to the ARIC study we also reported absolute 10-year risk estimates over the prediabetes range of all the three glycemic measures and these showed a higher absolute risk for HbA 1c than for FPG and 2hPG concentrations.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
We found no inflection point of risk in the association which is in line with the findings from the population-based Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study (13).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
We further evaluated the risk associated with different combinations of HbA 1c and FPG levels which enabled us to show that prediabetes HbA 1c levels are associated with elevated risk of CVD and death even when FPG levels are normal while the opposite is not the case (i.e. prediabetes FPG and normal HbA 1c levels).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"In support of this finding data from the ADDITION study (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care) showed that among individuals with normal glucose tolerance on an OGTT those with HbA 1c levels in the range 6.0-6.4% had 21% higher risk of all-cause mortality than those with HbA 1c levels ,6.0% (23) again suggesting that HbA 1c predicts mortality beyond fasting and 2-h glucose levels.",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
In relation to the use of FPG for diagnosis of prediabetes results from meta-analyses have shown that prediabetes defined by the WHO IFG criterion but not the ADA IFG criterion is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (24).,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
Similar results were found in relation to the risk of stroke (25).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
A recent meta-analysis however concluded that IFG defined by the ADA criterion is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality cardiovascular mortality coronary heart disease and stroke (14).,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
However a subgroup analysis revealed that among individuals aged 55 years or older ADA-defined IFG was not associated with all-cause mortality (14).,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
Combined with our results these findings suggest that the increased CVD and mortality risk associated with prediabetes FPG levels may decrease with age.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
It is thus likely that FPG is better for risk stratification in younger adults whereas HbA 1c is a better and more stable measure for health status in older adults but this hypothesis needs to be tested in study populations with a wide age range.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"Part of the stronger association found between HbA 1c and incident CVD may be explained by the capacity of HbA 1c to reflect average glycemia but HbA 1c may also indirectly capture information about other important pathophysiological processes such as iron metabolism and lowgrade inflammation (26,27).",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
However their causal effects need to in more detail.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
A major strength of the Whitehall II cohort is that the measures of FPG 2hPG and HbA 1c were obtained simultaneously and can be linked to validated measures of morbidity and mortality over a long follow-up period (20).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Deaths attributable to causes other than CVD were included in the analysis to avoid bias from competing risk.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
However two out of three of the composite events were related to CVD and sensitivity analyses with only CVD as outcome were consistent with our conclusions.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Another strength of the current analysis is the application of all the different definitions for prediabetes.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"Most previous studies have only focused on a single definition of prediabetes (either WHO/IEC or ADA) and thereby used different reference groups for defining normoglycemia (13,23,28).",Vistisen 2018.txt,1
Accordingly event rates cannot be compared directly across studies to derive solid evidence on the association of prediabetes with morbidity and mortality.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"This could also explain why previous meta-analyses on the relationship of prediabetes with future morbidity and mortality have shown conflicting results (12,13,24,25).",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
In the Whitehall II study some individuals with prediabetes may develop diabetes during follow-up and subsequently receive treatment to reduce CVD risk.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
This could potentially have biased the results in the sense that the calculated event rates for WHO/IEC-defined prediabetes are underestimated relative to the rates in ADAdefined prediabetes which have lower levels of glycemia and therefore are less likely to convert to diabetes during followup.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
It is also possible that the way diabetes has been diagnosed by general practitioners between the study visits during follow-up may have introduced bias.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Before 2012 diabetes was mostly diagnosed by measurement of FPG levels but after 2012 there has been a shift from FPG to HbA 1c for diagnosis of diabetes in clinical practice in the U.K. (9).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
However given that end of follow-up in our study was 30 June 2015 we expect these effects to even out.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Therefore it is reasonable to believe that the differential associations of FPG versus HbA 1c with CVD and mortality are not caused by diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and CVD risk in individuals identified by one specific diagnostic criterion over another during follow-up.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
During the last decades there has been an increased focus on identifying high-risk individuals in order to prevent future disease and premature mortality.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
As a result the diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for many diseases (29) which has increased sensitivity at the cost of specificity.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"With the adoption of HbA 1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes (9,30) the possibility of also using HbA 1c to risk stratify individuals for diabetes prevention is obvious but the challenge is to choose the optimal cut point.",Vistisen 2018.txt,1
"As shown in this and other studies (13,28) there does not seem to be an inflection point in the nondiabetes range for HbA 1c in the association with CVD or mortality.",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"Accordingly when deciding on the diagnostic test and thresholds used to guide preventive interventions one needs to consider the effectiveness of interventions as well as the health and economic consequences of false positives and false negatives (5,31).",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
The major diabetes prevention trials performed thus far have included individuals with IGT and not people identified as having high risk by FPG or HbA 1c (32)(33)(34).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Despite the limited evidence for prevention in these groups of individuals the current recommendations from ADA suggest that all individuals with prediabetes (IFG IGT or HbA 1c 5.7-6.4%) should be targeted for diabetes preventive efforts (lifestyle modification or metformin) (35).,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
Because of the poor concordance between the different diagnostic criteria it is questionable whether results from trials in IGT will apply to individuals identified by slightly elevated FPG or HbA 1c levels.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Thus intervention studies among individuals identified by FPG or HbA 1c aiming at reducing risk for diabetes and CVD are warranted in order to improve and modify the current recommendations (36).,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"More recent research also suggests that intermediate time points or different glucose curve patterns during an OGTT may be relevant to use for risk stratification purposes (37,38).",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
In addition it will be important to evaluate prediabetes in the context of overall CVD risk because of the close relationship of glycemia with other cardiovascular risk factors.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
Thus future risk prediction models should study whether easily measured risk factors and/or cheap biomarkers can jointly predict future diabetes CVD and mortality.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
In conclusion our study showed that individuals with prediabetes defined using the ADA criteria have a lower risk of CVD and all-cause mortality than individuals with prediabetes identified by the WHO/IEC criteria.,Vistisen 2018.txt,1
This difference was mainly driven by the lower incidence of CVD or death among individuals with IFG but normal levels of HbA 1c .,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
"Our results showed a high incidence rate of CVD and death in those with HbA 1c levels 5.7-5.9% which advocates for lowering the cut point for prediabetes to ,6.0% for CVD preventive interventions.",Vistisen 2018.txt,0
That said our study also shows that a substantial part of the excess risk in prediabetes is explained by other CVD risk factors suggesting that the use of prediabetes as an independent factor for risk stratification is questionable.,Vistisen 2018.txt,0
In a large cohort of suspected SAP patients without diabetes there were no overall associations between HbA1c and long-term risk of coronary events or mortality.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
Thus HbA1c measurements appear to have a limited value for clinical risk evaluation of such patients.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
Moreover our data add to prior works questioning an independent role of intermediate hyperglycemia in mediating acute atherosclerotic complications.,Rebnord 2015.txt,0
"In conclusion analysis of 241,499 Koreans participating in a health-screening program indicated that all-cause mortality risk significantly increased among diabetes subjects and that HR was higher in subjects with uncontrolled diabetes.",Rhee 2016.txt,0
Furthermore risk for mortality due to cancer significantly increased in diabetes subjects regardless of the glucose control status.,Rhee 2016.txt,0
Of note we demonstrated for the first time in a large Korean population that subjects with HbA1c higher than 6.5% and lower than 5.2% showed significantly increased mortality risk compared with those with HbA1c of 5.5% in subjects not being treated with anti-diabetic medications.,Rhee 2016.txt,1
