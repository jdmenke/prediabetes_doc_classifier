28882397,Ahn 2018,journal of cardiology,"OBJECTIVE: Diabetic women have a greater relative risk of coronary heart disease than diabetic men. However, the sex difference in the effect of fasting serum glucose levels below the diabetic range on the risk of coronary heart disease is unclear. We investigated whether the association between nondiabetic blood glucose levels and the incident risk of coronary heart disease is different between men and women. METHODS: The fasting serum glucose levels and other cardiovascular risk factors at baseline were measured in 159,702 subjects (100,144 men and 59,558 women). Primary outcomes were hospital admission and death due to coronary heart disease during the 11-year follow-up. RESULTS: The risk for coronary heart disease in women significantly increased with impaired fasting glucose levels (>=110mg/dL) compared to normal glucose levels (<100mg/dL), whereas the risk for coronary heart disease in men was significantly increased at a diabetic glucose range (>=126mg/dL). Women had a higher hazard ratio of coronary heart disease associated with the fasting serum glucose level than men (p for interaction with sex=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The stronger effect of the fasting serum glucose levels on the risk of coronary heart disease in women than in men was significant from a prediabetic range (>=110mg/dL)."
30703129,Ares 2019,plos one,"People who develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) are known to have a higher mortality risk. We estimated all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality-risks in our patient cohort according to categories of impaired glucose metabolism. This 18-year retrospective analysis included a region-wide, representative sample of a population aged 30-75 years. Age- and sex-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for 48 participants with diagnosed T2D, 83 with undiagnosed T2D (HbA1c ≥6.5%, fasting glycemia ≥126 mg/dL, or glycemia after 75 g glucose load ≥200 mg/dL); 296 with prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7%-6.4%, fasting glycemia 100-125 mg/dL, or glycemia after 75 g glucose load 140-199 mg/dL), and 607 with normoglycemia. Over 18,612 person-years, 32 individuals with undiagnosed T2D, 30 with diagnosed T2D, 62 with prediabetes, and 80 with normoglycemia died. Total sample crude mortality rate (MR) was 10.96 deaths per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. MR of the diagnosed T2D group was more than 3-times higher and that of newly diagnosed T2D was 2-times higher (34.72 and 21.42, respectively) than total sample MR. Adjusted HR for all-cause mortality was 2.02 (95% confidence interval 1.29-3.16) and 1.57 (95% CI 1.00-2.28) in the diagnosed T2D group and the newly diagnosed T2D group, respectively. Adjusted HR for cardiovascular mortality in the T2D group was 2.79 (95% CI 1.35-5.75); this risk was greatly increased in women with T2D: 6.72 (95% CI 2.50-18.07). In Asturias, age- and sex-standardized all-cause mortality is more than 2-times higher for adults with T2D than for adults without T2D. The HR for cardiovascular mortality is considerably higher in T2D women than in normoglycemic women."
17576864,Barr 2007,circulation,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. The relationship between milder elevations of blood glucose and mortality is less clear. This study investigated whether impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, as well as diabetes mellitus, increase the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 1999 to 2000, glucose tolerance status was determined in 10,428 participants of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). After a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 298 deaths occurred (88 CVD deaths). Compared with those with normal glucose tolerance, the adjusted all-cause mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for known diabetes mellitus and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus were 2.3 (1.6 to 3.2) and 1.3 (0.9 to 2.0), respectively. The risk of death was also increased in those with impaired fasting glucose (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.4) and impaired glucose tolerance (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0). Sixty-five percent of all those who died of CVD had known diabetes mellitus, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. Known diabetes mellitus (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.7) and impaired fasting glucose (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.1) were independent predictors for CVD mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and other traditional CVD risk factors, but impaired glucose tolerance was not (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the strong association between abnormal glucose metabolism and mortality, and it suggests that this condition contributes to a large number of CVD deaths in the general population. CVD prevention may be warranted in people with all categories of abnormal glucose metabolism."
10466662,Barzilay 1999,lancet,"BACKGROUND: The new fasting American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus rely mainly on fasting blood glucose concentrations and use a lower cut-off value for diagnosis than the WHO criteria. We aimed to assess the sensitivity of these criteria for the detection of cardiovascular disease, the main complication of diabetes mellitus in the elderly. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional and prospective analysis of 4515 participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study, an 8 year longitudinal study designed to identify factors related to the onset and course of cardiovascular disease in adults aged at least 65 years. We calculated the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease for the ADA and WHO criteria. FINDINGS: There was a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease among individuals with impaired glucose or newly diagnosed diabetes by both criteria than among those with normal glucose concentrations. However, because fewer individuals had abnormal glucose states by the fasting ADA criteria (22.3%) than by the WHO criteria (46.8%), the number of cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to abnormal glucose states was a third of that attributable by the WHO criteria (53 vs 159 cases per 10,000). For the two sets of criteria, the relative risk for incident cardiovascular disease (mean follow-up 5.9 years) was higher in individuals with impaired glucose and newly diagnosed diabetes than in those with normal glucose. Individuals classified as normal by the fasting ADA criteria had a higher absolute number of incident events (455 of 581 events) than those classified as normal by the WHO criteria (269 of 581 events). Fasting ADA criteria were therefore less sensitive than the WHO criteria for predicting cardiovascular disease among individuals with abnormal glucose (sensitivity, 28% vs 54%). INTERPRETATION: The new fasting ADA criteria seem to be less predictive than the WHO criteria for the burden of cardiovascular disease associated with abnormal glucose in the elderly."
25352076,Bergman 2015,diabetes and metabolism research and reviews,"Background: We describe the relationship between dysglycemia and long-term mortality and elucidate the relationship between blood glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and haemoglobin A1 (HbA1) and mortality. Methods: A cohort of 1410 individuals was followed for 33 years since 1980. Fasting and post-OGTT glucose parameters were used to categorize the cohort according to baseline glycemic status. Results: The mortality rate increased from 43% in normoglycemic individuals to 53.3, 61.7, 72.9 and 88.0% in those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), IFG/IGT and diabetes, respectively. The highest mortality rate, compared with the normoglycemic category, was observed in individuals with IFG/IGT and diabetes according to a Cox proportional hazard model (HR = 1.38, 95%CI 1.10-1.74 and HR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.70-2.70, respectively), followed by individuals with IGT and IFG, but this did not reach statistical significance. We speculate that the IFG group may represent a mixture of individuals en route from normal to the next two categories as well as another cohort whose glucose levels are stably set at the upper reaches of the normal distribution. Significant differences were found between 1 and 2 h glucose values (p < 0.001). Fasting, 60 and 120 min glucose values were positively associated with increasing HbA1 quintiles (p < 0.05). The mean HbA1 was significantly higher in those who died (p = 0.01). The highest mortality (58.8%) was observed in the upper HbA1 quintile that was also associated with the highest prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (17.2%). Conclusions: This study shows a continuous relationship between the severity of dysglycemia and long-term mortality and should promote the early recognition of prediabetes. The 1 h post-load glucose level was continuously associated with increasing HbA1 concentrations and may therefore serve as an early marker for abnormalities in glucose tolerance. An elevated 1 h post-load glucose level may potentially identify at-risk individuals well before the traditional 2 h glucose value."
31107107,Bjarnason 2019,european heart journal acute cardiovascular care,"Background: Dysglycemia is a well-established risk factor of coronary artery disease. Less is known of the prognostic effect of dysglycemia in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with ACSs according to glucometabolic categories. Methods: Patients with ACSs were consecutively included in the study. Among those with no previous history of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) glucose metabolism was evaluated with fasting glucose in plasma, glycated hemoglobin and a standard 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Patients were classified having normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, newly detected T2DM (nT2DM) and previously known T2DM (kT2DM). The clinical outcome parameters were death or myocardial infarction and other major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Results: A total of 372 ACS patients (male 75.8%, 65.1 years (SD: 11.8)) constituted the study population. The proportion diagnosed with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, nT2DM and kT2DM was 20.7%, 46.5%, 6.2% and 26.6%, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 2.9 years. Patients with prediabetes, nT2DM and kT2DM had a hazard ratio of 5.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-44.6), 10.9 (95% CI 1.2-98.3) and 14.9 (95% CI 2.0-113.7), respectively, for death/myocardial infarction and 1.4 (95% CI 0.6-3.1), 2.9 (95% CI 1.1-8.0) and 3.3 (95% CI 1.5-7.6), respectively, for a composite of MACEs. Conclusion: Patients with ACS and nT2DM or kT2DM were at increased risk of death/myocardial infarction and MACE compared with patients with normal glucose metabolism after approximately three years of follow-up."
12663606,Bonora 2003,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at prospectively evaluating carotid atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Within a prospective population-based survey examining 888 subjects aged 40-79 years, 303 subjects were identified as fulfilling World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and 158 as fulfilling the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)-III criteria for diagnosing the metabolic syndrome. The 5-year change in carotid status, as assessed by echo-duplex scanning, and incident fatal and nonfatal CHD, as assessed by medical history and death certificates, were compared in subjects with the metabolic syndrome and in the rest of the sample (control subjects). RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, subjects with the metabolic syndrome by WHO criteria had an increased 5-year incidence and progression of carotid atherosclerosis: 51 vs. 35% developed new plaques (P = 0.021) and 34 vs. 19% developed carotid stenosis >40% (P = 0.002) after adjusting for several confounders. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome by these criteria also had an increased incidence of CHD during follow-up: 8 vs. 3% in control subjects (P = 0.012). Similar results were found when the NCEP-ATPIII criteria were used. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with the metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for both progressive carotid atherosclerosis and CHD."
20536951,Brunner 2010,diabetic medicine,"AIMS: British guidelines on vascular disease prevention recommend adding a random (casual) blood glucose measurement to a lipid profile in those aged > or = 40 years. To assess this recommendation, we compared the predictive value of a risk model based on the Framingham risk score alone to one which additionally included information on fasting blood glucose, with respect to incident coronary heart disease (CHD) over 11 years. METHOD: Men and women aged 40-63 years in Whitehall II were followed up for incident CHD: death/non-fatal myocardial infarction; angina confirmed by doctor diagnosis or electrocardiogram (ECG) and all first events. Fasting blood glucose was specified as a continuous variable or categorized by World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 glycaemic status (normal glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose or newly diagnosed diabetes). RESULTS: The hazard ratio for incident CHD was 1.10 (95%CI 1.09; 1.12) in men and 1.13 (1.10; 1.17) in women per percentage point increase in Framingham risk. The excess risk remained unchanged in models which added glycaemic status or continuous fasting glucose. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the Framingham score and incident coronary heart disease [0.70 (0.68; 0.73)] did not change when glycaemic status or fasting glucose was added to the prediction model. Reclassification with these modified models improved discrimination based on the Framingham score alone when glycaemic status was added, net reclassification improvement 2.4% (95% CI 0.2%; 4.6%), but not when fasting glucose was added. CONCLUSION: Better detection of unrecognized diabetes is a valuable consequence of including a random blood glucose in a vascular risk profile. Our results suggest that this strategy is unlikely to improve risk stratification for CHD."
20573752,Cederberg 2010,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: A1C has been proposed as a new indicator for high risk of type 2 diabetes. The long-term predictive power and comparability of elevated A1C with the currently used high-risk indicators remain unclear. We assessed A1C, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as predictors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) at 10 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective population-based study of 593 inhabitants from northern Finland, born in 1935, was conducted between 1996 and 2008. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted at baseline and follow-up, and A1C was determined at baseline. Those with a history of diabetes were excluded from the study. Elevated A1C was defined as 5.7-6.4%. Incident type 2 diabetes was confirmed by two OGTTs. Cardiovascular outcome was measured as incident CVD or CVD mortality. Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to predict diabetes, CVD, and CVD mortality at 10 years. Receiver operating characteristic curves compared predictive values of A1C, IGT, and IFG. RESULTS: Incidence of diabetes during the follow-up was 17.1%. Two of three of the cases of newly diagnosed diabetes were predicted by a raise in >or=1 of the markers. Elevated A1C, IGT, or IFG preceded diabetes in 32.8, 40.6, and 21.9%, respectively. CVD was predicted by an intermediate and diabetic range of 2-h glucose but only by diabetic A1C levels in women. CONCLUSIONS: A1C predicted 10-year risk of type 2 diabetes at a range of A1C 5.7-6.4% but CVD only in women at A1C >or=6.5%."
31044609,Chattopadhyayv 2019,diabetes & vascular disease research,"Background: Effect of pre-diabetes mellitus on post-myocardial infarction prognosis is unclear. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of 1056 myocardial infarction survivors with fasting plasma glucose and 2-h post-load plasma glucose measured. Major adverse cardiovascular events included death, non-fatal reinfarction and ischaemic stroke. Cox proportional hazard regression identified predictors of event-free survival. Continuous net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement determined the added predictive value of glycaemic indices. Results: Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 25.1% and 16.4% patients with and without pre-diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio with pre-diabetes mellitus: 1.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.17-2.08; p = 0.003) in the whole cohort and in 24.1% and 17.2% patients (hazard ratio with pre-diabetes mellitus, 1.43; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.98; p = 0.033) in the matched cohort, respectively. Pre-diabetes mellitus predicted major adverse cardiovascular events-free survival in whole (hazard ratio: 1.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.89; p = 0.033) and matched cohorts (hazard ratio: 1.42; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.99; p = 0.043). The 2-h post-load plasma glucose, but not fasting plasma glucose, predicted major adverse cardiovascular events-free survival in the whole (hazard ratio: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.26; p < 0.0001) and matched cohorts (hazard ratio: 1.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.31; p < 0.0001). Adding 2-h post-load plasma glucose to models containing fasting plasma glucose, significantly improved net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement for both cohorts, but not vice versa. Conclusion: Pre-diabetes mellitus predicts major adverse cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. The 2-h post-load plasma glucose predicts prognosis better than fasting plasma glucose in these patients."
30127212,Chen 2018,chinese medical journal,"Background: The impact of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) on survival outcomes in patients with acute heart failure (HF) is unclear, and the relationship between intensity of glycemic control of FPG in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and HF prognosis remains uncertain. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of FPG in patients with acute HF. Methods: A total of 624 patients hospitalized with acute HF from October 2000 to April 2014 were enrolled in this study. All patients were stratified by three groups according to their admission FPG levels (i.e., DM, impaired fasting glucose [IFG], and non‐DM). All‐cause and cardiovascular mortality was the primary end point, and HF re‐hospitalization was the secondary end point during follow‐up period. Results: A total of 587 patients were included in final analysis. The all‐cause mortality rates of patients with DM, IFG, and non‐DM were 55.5%, 40.3%, and 39.2%, with significant difference (P = 0.001). Moreover, compared with those with IFG (34.3%) and non‐DM (32.6%), patients with DM had significantly higher rate of cardiovascular mortality (45.1%). Multiple Cox regression analysis showed that DM as well as IFG was related to all‐cause mortality (DM: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.936, P < 0.001; IFG: HR = 1.672, P = 0.019) and cardiovascular mortality (DM: HR = 1.739, P < 0.001; IFG: HR = 1.817, P = 0.013). However, they were both unrelated to HF re‐hospitalization. DM patients with strictly controlled blood glucose (FPG <3.9 mmol/L) had higher all‐cause mortality than patients with non‐DM, IFG, and DM patients with moderately controlled glucose (3.9 mmol/L≤ FPG <7.0 mmol/L). Likewise, both the primary end point and secondary end point were found to be worse in DM patients with poorly controlled blood glucose (FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L). Conclusions: IFG and DM were associated with higher all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with acute HF. The association between mortality and admission FPG in DM patients with acute HF appeared U‐shaped."
19061718,Chien 2008,american heart journal,"BACKGROUND: Whether fasting glucose is superior to postchallenge glucose or insulin level for prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial. The aim of our study was to compare fasting, postchallenge glucose and other markers as predictors of CVD in a community-based prospective cohort study among 2,165 adult participants. METHODS: A standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed, with measurements of fasting and 2-hour postchallenge plasma glucose and insulin levels. We defined the CVD outcome as incident coronary heart disease and stroke. Cox regression model was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) for CVD. RESULTS: A total of 166 individuals developed major CVD events during 10.5 years of follow-up. Both fasting and postchallenge glucose were significantly associated with CVD risk (adjusted RR in the highest quartile vs the lowest quartile 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.86 for fasting glucose; RR in highest quartile 2.05, 95% CI 1.23-3.42 for postchallenge glucose). Postchallenge and fasting glucose had similar areas of receiver operative characteristics curves (0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.72 for postchallenge glucose; 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.72 for fasting glucose). In mutually adjusted models, fasting and postchallenge glucose remained significant risk factors for CVD, whereas insulin resistance variables became nonsigificant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that fasting and postchallenge glucose concentrations are independent predictors of CVD risk among ethnic Chinese in Taiwan."
28698884,de Abreu 2017,journal of diabetes research,"AIMS: Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes are increasing in prevalence worldwide and lead to serious health problems. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the association between impaired fasting glucose or diabetes and mortality over a 10-year period in Australian women. METHODS: This study included 1167 women (ages 20-94 yr) enrolled in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in diabetes, IFG, and normoglycaemia were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Women with diabetes were older and had higher measures of adiposity, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides compared to the IFG and normoglycaemia groups (all p < 0.001). Mortality rate was greater in women with diabetes compared to both the IFG and normoglycaemia groups (HR 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.7). Mortality was not different in women with IFG compared to those with normoglycaemia (HR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports an association between diabetes and all-cause mortality. However, no association was detected between IFG and all-cause mortality. We also showed that mortality in Australian women with diabetes continues to be elevated and women with IFG are a valuable target for prevention of premature mortality associated with diabetes."
11176766,DECODE 2001,archives of internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: New diagnostic criteria for diabetes based on fasting blood glucose (FBG) level were approved by the American Diabetes Association. The impact of using FBG only has not been evaluated thoroughly. The fasting and the 2-hour glucose (2h-BG) criteria were compared with regard to the prediction of mortality. METHODS: Existing baseline data on glucose level at fasting and 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test from 10 prospective European cohort studies including 15 388 men and 7126 women aged 30 to 89 years, with a median follow-up of 8.8 years, were analyzed. Hazards ratios for death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke were estimated. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the inclusion of FBG did not add significant information on the prediction of 2h-BG alone (P>.10 for various causes), whereas the addition of 2h-BG to FBG criteria significantly improved the prediction (P<.001 for all causes and P<.005 for cardiovascular disease). In a model including FBG and 2h-BG simultaneously, hazards ratios (95% confidence intervals) in subjects with diabetes on 2h-BG were 1.73 (1.45-2.06) for all causes, 1.40 (1.02-1.92) for cardiovascular disease, 1.56 (1.03-2.36) for coronary heart disease, and 1.29 (0.66-2.54) for stroke mortality, compared with the normal 2h-BG group. Compared with the normal FBG group, the corresponding hazards ratios in subjects with diabetes on FBG were 1.21 (1.01-1.44), 1.20 (0.88-1.64), 1.09 (0.71-1.67), and 1.64 (0.88-3.07), respectively. The largest number of excess deaths was observed in subjects who had impaired glucose tolerance but normal FBG levels. CONCLUSION: The 2h-BG is a better predictor of deaths from all causes and cardiovascular disease than is FBG."
23731526,Deedwania 2013,international journal of cardiology,"BACKGROUND: Whether prediabetes is an independent risk factor for incident heart failure (HF) in non-diabetic older adults remains unclear. METHODS: Of the 4602 Cardiovascular Health Study participants, age>=65 years, without baseline HF and diabetes, 2157 had prediabetes, defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125 mg/dL. Propensity scores for prediabetes, estimated for each of the 4602 participants, were used to assemble a cohort of 1421 pairs of individuals with and without prediabetes, balanced on 44 baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 73 years, 57% were women, and 13% African American. Incident HF occurred in 18% and 20% of matched participants with and without prediabetes, respectively (hazard ratio {HR} associated with prediabetes, 0.90; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.76-1.07; p=0.239). Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for incident HF associated with prediabetes among 4602 pre-match participants were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07-1.40; p=0.003) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.85-1.14; p=0.826), respectively. Among matched individuals, prediabetes had no independent association with incident acute myocardial infarction (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.81-1.28; p=0.875), angina pectoris (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77-1.12; p=0.451), stroke (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.70-1.06; p=0.151) or all cause mortality (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11; p=0.840). CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that prediabetes is an independent risk factor for incident HF, other cardiovascular events or mortality in community-dwelling older adults. These findings question the wisdom of routine screening for prediabetes in older adults and targeted interventions to prevent adverse outcomes in older adults with prediabetes."
26825592,Deng 2017,european journal of nutrition,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic inflammation is associated with increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes. The role of pro-inflammatory diet in the risk of cancer mortality and CVD mortality in prediabetics is unclear. We examined the relationship between diet-associated inflammation, as measured by dietary inflammatory index (DII) score, and mortality, with special focus on prediabetics. METHODS: This prospective cohort study used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). We categorized 13,280 eligible participants, ages 20-90 years, according to glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) level and identified 2681 with prediabetes, defined as a glycosylated hemoglobin percentage of 5.7-6.4. Computation of DII scores and all statistical analyses were conducted in 2015. The DII was computed based on baseline dietary intake assessed using 24-h dietary recalls (1988-1994). Mortality was determined from the National Death Index records through 2006. Over follow-up ranging between 135 and 168 person-months, a total of 3016 deaths were identified, including 676 cancer, 192 lung cancer, 176 digestive-tract cancer, and 1328 CVD deaths. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate hazard ratios. RESULTS: The prevalence of prediabetes was 20.19 %. After controlling for age, sex, race, HgbA1c, current smoking, physical activity, BMI, and systolic blood pressure, DII scores in tertile III (vs tertile I) was significantly associated with mortality from all causes (HR 1.39, 95 % CI 1.13, 1.72), CVD (HR 1.44, 95 % CI 1.02, 2.04), all cancers (HR 2.02, 95 % CI 1.27, 3.21), and digestive-tract cancer (HR 2.89, 95 % CI 1.08, 7.71). Findings for lung cancer (HR 2.01, 95 % CI 0.93, 4.34) suggested a likely effect. These results were moderately enhanced after additional adjustment for serum low density lipoprotein and triglyceride and following eliminating deaths during the first year. CONCLUSIONS: A pro-inflammatory diet, as indicated by higher DII scores, is associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, all-cancer, and digestive-tract cancer mortality among prediabetic subjects."
24089546,Ding 2014,diabetes care,"Objective: Known diabetes is an independent predictor for mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients; however, whether other glucose abnormalities are associated with death risk in CAD patients is unclear. The goal of this study was to examine the association between different glucose states and the risks of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among CAD patients. Research design and methods: The study cohort included 1,726 CAD patients who were 40-85 years of age in the Guangdong Coronary Artery Disease Cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association of baseline glucose status with risk of mortality. Results: During a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 129 deaths were recorded, 109 of which were due to CVD. The multivariable-adjusted (age; sex; education; marriage; leisure-time physical activity; smoking; alcohol drinking; BMI; systolic blood pressure; total and HDL cholesterol; glomerular filtration rate; type, severity, duration, and treatment of CAD; history of heart failure; and use of antihypertensive, cholesterol-lowering, and antiplatelet drugs) hazard ratios in normoglycemia, impaired glucose regulation (IGR), newly diagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes were 1.00, 1.58 (95% CI 0.90-2.77), 2.41 (1.42-4.11), and 2.29 (1.36-3.84) for all-cause mortality and 1.00, 1.89 (1.01-3.54), 2.74 (1.50-5.01), and 2.73 (1.52-4.91) for CVD mortality. Assessing fasting plasma glucose only, impaired fasting glucose and newly diagnosed and known diabetes were also associated with increased risks of all-cause and CVD mortality compared with normoglycemia."
19940278,Doi 2010,stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies have shown the association between glucose tolerance status defined by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and the development of different types of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: A total of 2421 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged 40 to 79 years who underwent the oral glucose tolerance test were followed up for 14 years. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, the risks of ischemic stroke in both sexes and coronary heart disease (CHD) in women were significantly higher in subjects with diabetes determined by the World Health Organization criteria than in those with normal glucose tolerance even after adjustment for other confounding factors, but such association was not seen for CHD in men (ischemic stroke: adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=2.54, P=0.002 in men; adjusted HR=2.02, P=0.03 in women; CHD: adjusted HR=1.26, P=0.47 in men; adjusted HR=3.46, P=0.002 in women). Similar associations were observed for fasting plasma glucose levels of >or=7.0 mmol/L (ischemic stroke: adjusted HR=2.15, P=0.03 in men; adjusted HR=2.10, P=0.045 in women; CHD: adjusted HR=1.29, P=0.47 in men; adjusted HR=3.83, P=0.003 in women) and for 2 hour postload glucose levels of >or=11.1 mmol/L (ischemic stroke: adjusted HR=2.71, P=0.003 in men; adjusted HR=2.19, P=0.03 in women; CHD: adjusted HR=1.58, P=0.16 in men; adjusted HR=4.44, P<0.001 in women). The age-adjusted incidences of ischemic stroke and CHD did not significantly increase in subjects with impaired fasting glycemia or impaired glucose tolerance in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diabetes is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke in both sexes and CHD in women in the Japanese population."
20227262,Donahue 2011,"nutrition, metabolism and cardiovascular diseases","Background and aims: There is little epidemiological evidence regarding the association of impaired glucose metabolism with recurrent cardiovascular events. We therefore examined potential sex differences in the effect of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) on recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a community-based study of survivors of a first acute myocardial infarction (MI). Methods and results: This report focuses on 1226 incident MI cases (28.4% women) discharged alive from area hospitals in the Western New York Acute MI Study (1996-2004). Deaths and underlying cause of death were determined via query of the National Death Index (Plus) Retrieval Program with follow-up through December 31, 2004. Outcomes reported included fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or coronary revascularization surgery and total stroke. Traditional CHD risk factors and other explanatory variables were determined by clinical examination after the first acute event. Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125mg/dl. During a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, there were 91 recurrent events (26.1%) in women and 173 recurrent events (19.7%) in men. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratios for recurrent cardiovascular events were 1.96 (95% CI: 1.15-3.16) and 2.59 (1.56-4.30) in women with IFG and with diabetes, respectively, compared to normoglycemic women. Among men, neither IFG nor diabetes was independently related to risk of recurrence. Conclusions: In this study, IFG was a strong risk factor for recurrent cardiovascular events only among women. These results suggest that increased cardiovascular risk in MI survivors begins at lower glucose levels in women than men."
26486189,Eastwood 2015,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: We examined longitudinal associations between prediabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) in Europeans and South Asians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a U.K. cohort study of 1,336 Europeans and 1,139 South Asians, aged 40-69 years at baseline (1988-1991). Assessment included blood pressure, blood tests, anthropometry, and questionnaires. Prediabetes was determined by OGTT or HbA1c, using either International Expert Committee (IEC) (HbA1c 6.0-6.5% [42-48 mmol/mol]) or American Diabetes Association (ADA) (HbA1c 5.7-6.5% [39-48 mmol/mol]) cut points. Incident CHD and stroke were established at 20 years from death certification, hospital admission, primary care record review, and participant report. RESULTS: Compared with normoglycemic individuals, IEC-defined prediabetes was related to both CHD and CVD risk in Europeans but not South Asians (subhazard ratio for CHD 1.68 [95% CI 1.19, 2.38] vs. 1.00 [0.75, 1.33], ethnicity interaction P = 0.008, and for CVD 1.49 [1.08, 2.07] vs. 1.03 [0.78, 1.36], ethnicity interaction P = 0.04). Conversely, IEC-defined prediabetes was associated with stroke risk in South Asians but not Europeans (1.73 [1.03, 2.90] vs. 0.85 [0.44, 1.64], ethnicity interaction P = 0.11). Risks were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, total to-HDL cholesterol ratio, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive use. Associations were weaker for OGTT or ADA-defined prediabetes. Conversion from prediabetes to diabetes was greater in South Asians, but accounting for time to conversion did not account for these ethnic differences. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between prediabetes and CVD differed by prediabetes diagnostic criterion, type of CVD, and ethnicity, with associations being present for overall CVD in Europeans but not South Asians. Substantiation of these findings and investigation of potential explanations are required."
26405556,Evans 2015,bmj open diabetes research & care,"OBJECTIVE: Mortality among adults of all ages diagnosed with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) in Tayside, Scotland, UK, was evaluated using routinely collected healthcare data sets. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using record-linked data in 2003-2008, all instances of blood glucose testing in the population defined 2 cohorts of patients aged 18+years: those with IGR (whether impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)) according to the WHO criteria, and those who were normoglycemic. They were followed in survival analyses for mortality or cardiovascular mortality (censoring deaths that occurred within a 30-day period of testing), to derive HRs (with 95% CI) for IGR status using Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, and an area measure of deprivation. RESULTS: There were 2 372 712 tests for 214 094 patients, with 196 799 patients in the non-IGR cohort and 50 080 in the IGR cohort. During follow up, 19 147 (9.7%) and 8397 (16.8%) patients died in 2 cohorts, respectively, with mortality rates of 33.2/1000 patient-years and 70.7/1000 patient-years. In multivariable analyses, the overall adjusted risk of mortality for IGR was 1.16 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.20). However, it was 2.59 (95% CI 2.17 to 3.10) for people aged <45 years, decreasing to 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) in those aged 85+years. The HRs for cardiovascular mortality were lower overall, but they followed the same pattern, with statistically significant increased risks for patients aged <64 years only. The mortality risk was highest among patients with IGT. CONCLUSIONS: IGR is associated with an increased mortality risk which declines with age. It is therefore important to prioritize young people with IGR for prevention; but less important to be aggressive about risk factor modification in older people."
30862424,Fang 2019,primary care diabetes,"Aims: To investigate the potential association between impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and all-cause mortality among older men at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in China. Methods: In this prospective observational study, 460 older men aged ≥60 years were determined to have either IGT or normal glucose tolerance (NGT) based on an oral glucose tolerance test conducted between May 2005 and May 2007. IGT and NGT were diagnosed according to the 1999 WHO diagnostic criteria. All subjects were followed until March 2017. The primary outcome studied was all-cause mortality. Multivariate Cox models were used to estimate relative risk for all-cause mortality. Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.2 years, forty-three (21.4%) subjects in the IGT group and twenty-nine (11.2%) subjects in the NGT group died (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.28-3.28, P=0.003). Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis demonstated that IGT was significantly associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality, composite cardiovascular outcome, nonfatal stroke and heart failure after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Logistic regression analysis showed that IGT at baseline (P<0.05) rather than incident type 2 diabetes was a risk factor of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: IGT was significantly associated with all-cause mortality in older Chinese men at high risk for CVD."
29055637,Farhan 2019,jacc: cardiovascular imaging,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of pre-diabetes (pre-DM) on coronary plaque characteristics and ischemic outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Background: Pre-DM (i.e., the early stages of glucometabolic disturbance) is common among patients with ACS, but the extent to which pre-DM influences coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for adverse ischemic events is unclear. Methods: In the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in Coronary Tree) study, patients with ACS underwent quantitative coronary angiography, grayscale intravascular ultrasound, and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their glucometabolic status, as defined by the American Diabetes Association: normal glucose metabolism (NGM), pre-DM, and diabetes mellitus (DM). These groups were compared with regard to coronary plaque characteristics and the risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (defined as cardiac death or arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina). Results: Among 547 patients, 162 (29.6%) had NGM, 202 (36.9%) had pre-DM, and 183 (33.4%) had DM. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to intravascular ultrasound findings indicative of vulnerable plaques. Patients with DM had a higher crude rate of MACEs than those with pre-DM or NGM (25.9% vs. 16.3% and 16.1%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). In an adjusted Cox regression model using NGM as the reference group, DM (hazard ratio: 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 3.86; p = 0.006) but not pre-DM (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 0.71 to 2.33; p = 0.41) was associated with increased risk for MACEs. Conclusions: Impaired glucose metabolism is common among patients presenting with ACS. DM but not pre-DM is associated with an increased risk for MACEs. Thus, preventing patients from progressing from pre-DM to DM is important. (PROSPECT: An Imaging Study in Patients With Unstable Atherosclerotic Lesions; NCT00180466)."
11231448,Fisman 2001,american heart journal,"Background: The issue of whether glucose concentrations below the diabetic threshold may be predictive of increased cardiovascular risk has not yet been fully elucidated. The current study evaluates the prognosis of nondiabetic patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) over a 7.7-year follow-up period. Methods: A total of 11,853 patients with documented coronary artery disease aged between 45 and 74 years were examined. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of their fasting blood glucose levels at screening: nondiabetic individuals, patients with IFG, and undiagnosed diabetic patients. Patients who were on any type of pharmacologic antidiabetic treatment were excluded from the study. Mortality rates were assessed separately for each group. Results: The population comprised 9773 nondiabetic patients (82.4%, glucose up to 109 mg/dL), 1258 patients with IFG levels (10.6%, glucose 110-125 mg/dL), and 822 diabetic subjects (7%, glucose > or =126 mg/dL). Patients were followed up from 6.2 to 9.0 years (mean follow-up period 7.7 +/- 1.5 years). Crude mortality was lower in the nondiabetic subjects than in the 2 other groups. All-cause mortality in the nondiabetic group was 14.3% compared to 20.1% in patients with IFG and 24.3% in the undiagnosed (P <.001). Multivariate adjustment showed the lowest mortality in nondiabetic subjects, who exhibited a survival rate of 0.86 at the end of the follow-up, whereas the lowest survival-0.75-was seen among undiagnosed diabetic patients (P =.0001). An intermediate value of 0.78 was documented for patients with IFG (P <.01). After multivariate analysis, with nondiabetic patients as the reference group, IFG was identified as a consistent predictor of increased all-cause and IHD mortality with hazard ratios of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.21-1.59) and 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.64), respectively. Conclusions: The main finding of this study is the substantially increased mortality rate among nondiabetic coronary patients with IFG, who had fasting glucose levels markedly lower than hitherto acknowledged as defining overt diabetes."
16186276,Fox 2005,diabetes care,"Objective: Diabetes is a major risk factor for the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the U.S. Whether pre-diabetes is associated with the development of kidney disease is unclear. Research design and methods: Subjects free of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were drawn from the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort (1991-1995), given an oral glucose tolerance test, and followed for an average of 7 years for development of CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of <59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in women and <64 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in men). Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors including age, sex, hypertension, smoking, BMI, total and HDL cholesterol levels, and prevalent myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, were used to estimate the odds of patients developing kidney disease among glycemic categories. Results: Of 2,398 subjects (53% women; mean age 54 years), 63% were normoglycemic, 29% had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 3.4% were newly diabetic, and 4.6% had known diabetes. By glycemic category, mean GFR at follow-up was 87, 85, 82, and 78 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. The fully adjusted odds of developing CKD were 0.98 (95% CI 0.67-1.45), 1.71 (95% CI 0.83-3.55), and 1.93 (95% CI 1.06-3.49) among those with IFG or IGT, newly diagnosed diabetes, or known diabetes, respectively, compared with those who were normoglycemic at baseline. Among participants without diabetes, metabolic syndrome was not associated with kidney disease at follow-up (odds ratio 1.46, P = 0.06). Conclusions: Cardiovascular disease risk factors explain much of the relationship between prediabetes and the development of chronic kidney disease. Clinical trials are warranted to determine whether vascular risk factor modification can slow the decline of kidney function among those with pre-diabetes."
26571120,George 2015,plos one,"Objective: To investigate the prognostic effect of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (NDM) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) post myocardial infarction (MI). Research design and methods: Retrospective cohort study of 768 patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus post-MI at one centre in Yorkshire between November 2005 and October 2008. Patients were categorised as normal glucose tolerance (NGT n = 337), IGT (n = 279) and NDM (n = 152) on pre- discharge oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Primary end-point was the first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, severe heart failure (HF) or non-haemorrhagic stroke. Secondary end-points were all cause mortality and individual components of MACE. Results: Prevalence of NGT, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), IGT and NDM changed from 90%, 6%, 0% and 4% on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to 43%, 1%, 36% and 20% respectively after OGTT. 102 deaths from all causes (79 as first events of which 46 were cardiovascular), 95 non fatal MI, 18 HF and 9 non haemorrhagic strokes occurred during 47.2 ± 9.4 months follow up. Event free survival was lower in IGT and NDM groups. IGT (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.06-2.24, p = 0.024) and NDM (HR 2.15, 95% CI: 1.42-3.24, p = 0.003) independently predicted MACE free survival. IGT and NDM also independently predicted incidence of MACE. NDM but not IGT increased the risk of secondary end-points. Conclusion: Presence of IGT and NDM in patients presenting post-MI, identified using OGTT, is associated with increased incidence of MACE and is associated with adverse outcomes despite adequate secondary prevention."
25785731,Gordon-Dseagu 2015,plos one,"BACKGROUND: The extent that controlled diabetes impacts upon mortality, compared with uncontrolled diabetes, and how pre-diabetes alters mortality risk remain issues requiring clarification. METHODS: We carried out a cohort study of 22,106 Health Survey for England participants with a HbA1C measurement linked with UK mortality records. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox regression. RESULTS: Average follow-up time was seven years and there were 1,509 deaths within the sample. Compared with the non-diabetic and normoglycaemic group (HbA1C <5.7% [<39 mmol/mol] and did not indicate diabetes), undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1C >=6.5% [>=48 mmol/mol] and did not indicate diabetes) inferred an increased risk of mortality for all-causes (HR 1.40, 1.09-1.80) and CVD (1.99, 1.35-2.94), as did uncontrolled diabetes (diagnosed diabetes and HbA1C >=6.5% [>=48 mmol/mol]) and diabetes with moderately raised HbA1C (diagnosed diabetes and HbA1C 5.7-<6.5% [39-<48 mmol/mol]). Those with controlled diabetes (diagnosed diabetes and HbA<5.7% [<39 mmol/mol]) had an increased HR in relation to mortality from CVD only. Pre-diabetes (those who did not indicate diagnosed diabetes and HbA1C 5.7-<6.5% [39-<48 mmol/mol]) was not associated with increased mortality, and raised HbA1C did not appear to have a statistically significant impact upon cancer mortality. Adjustment for BMI and socioeconomic status had a limited impact upon our results. We also found women had a higher all-cause and CVD mortality risk compared with men. CONCLUSIONS: We found higher rates of all cause and CVD mortality among those with raised HbA1C, but not for those with pre diabetes, compared with those without diabetes. This excess differed by sex and diabetes status. The large number of deaths from cancer and CVD globally suggests that controlling blood glucose levels and policies to prevent hyperglycaemia should be considered public health priorities."
25585379,Hadaegh 2015,international journal of cardiology,"BACKGROUND: To determine the impact of silent coronary artery disease (CAD), in different levels of glucose regulation at baseline, i.e., those with normal fasting glucose/normal glucose tolerance (NFG/NGT), pre-diabetic and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (NDM), on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality in Iranian populations. METHODS: The study population included 1809 individuals, aged >=50years, free of CVD at baseline with a median follow-up of 12.1years. To explore the risk of CVD and mortality associated with the presence of silent CAD (as defined by Minnesota coding criteria for baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) in the absence of a history of CVD) in each of the glucose regulation categories, multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the presence of silent CAD, compared to the corresponding non silent CAD counterpart, as reference. RESULTS: During follow-up 382 CVD (321 coronary heart disease) and 208 deaths (91 CVD mortality) occurred. Among the female population, the presence of silent CAD, independent of traditional risk factors, significantly increased the risk of CVD for population with NFG/NGT [2.40 (1.33-4.35)] and pre-diabetes [HR: 2.04 (1.14-3.63)]; however, in the male population the risk was significant for CVD [3.04 (1.53-6.05)] and mortality events [2.60 (1.22-5.56)] in the NDM population and marginally significant for mortality events in NFG/NGT. CONCLUSION: Different strategies should be considered for silent CAD in males and females with different levels of glucose regulation. It might be justified that screening ECG for prevention of CVD events should be considered mainly among non-diabetic women and men with NDM."
28748918,Hajebrahimi 2017,journal of human hypertension,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combinations of blood pressure and glucose tolerance status on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. A total of 7619 participants aged ?30 years old were stratified to nine categories as follows: (1) normotension (NTN) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (reference group), (2) NTN and pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM), (3) NTN and DM, (4) pre-hypertension (pre-HTN) and NGT, (5) pre-HTN and pre-DM, (6) pre-HTN and DM, (7) HTN and NGT, (8) HTN and pre-DM and (9) HTN and DM. Cox proportional hazards were applied to calculate the multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) of different groups for outcomes. For all-cause mortality outcomes, prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) was also adjusted. In a median follow-up of 11.3 years, 696 CVD and 412 all-cause mortality events occurred. Among the population free from CVD at baseline (n=7249), presence of HTN was associated with increased risk of CVD, regardless of glucose tolerance status with HRs of 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.49-2.61), 2.25 (1.68-3.02) and 3.16 (2.28-4.37) for phenotypes of HTN and NGT, HTN and pre-DM and HTN and DM for CVD, respectively; corresponding HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.65 (95% CI, 1.15-2.37), 1.69 (1.15-2.49) and 2.73 (1.80-4.14), respectively. Phenotypes of NTN and pre-DM (1.48; 1.03-2.14) and NTN and DM (2.04; 1.06-3.92) were also associated with CVD and all-cause mortality, respectively. HTN was significantly associated with CVD/mortality events, regardless of glucose tolerance status. Blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg among pre-diabetic/diabetic population, not on antihypertensive medications, was generally associated with worse outcomes."
12364347,Henry 2002,hypertension,"Impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L [110 to 125 mg/dL]) is a common glycemic disorder which usually progress to diabetes mellitus. The relationships between impaired fasting glucose, other risk factors including blood pressure, and mortality have never been clearly investigated. We studied 63 443 consecutive men (ages 21 to 60 years), each of whom had a routine health examination with a fasting plasma glucose measurement. Men with known ischemic cardiac disease and treatment for diabetes or hypertension were excluded. Impaired fasting glucose was found in 10 773 (17.0%) of these men. Mean body mass index, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and systolic, diastolic, and pulse blood pressure were significantly higher for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with those men with normal fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 3.9 to 6.0 mmol/L). When adjusted for confounding variables, relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with impaired fasting glucose was dependent on systolic blood pressure level (1.02 [95% CI: 0.62 to 1.70] when <140 mm Hg and 2.10 [95% CI: 1.16 to 3.80] between 140 and 160 mm Hg). Inversely, relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with moderate systolic hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg) compared with normal systolic blood pressure (<140 mm Hg) was highly dependent on the glycemic status (2.97 [95% CI: 1.58 to 5.55] for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with 1.35 [95% CI: 0.84 to 2.18] in those with normal fasting glucose). Similar results were found concerning overall mortality. In conclusion, the presence of moderate systolic hypertension can identify subjects with impaired fasting glucose who are at risk of cardiovascular and overall mortality, and vice versa, probably through the metabolic syndrome."
31124695,Hermanides 2019,european heart journal acute cardiovascular care,"Background: Long-term clinical outcome is less well known in up to presentation persons unknown with diabetes mellitus who present with acute myocardial infarction and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels on admission. We aimed to study the prognostic impact of deranged HbA1c at presentation on long-term mortality in patients not known with diabetes, presenting with acute myocardial infarction. Methods: A single-centre, large, prospective observational study in patients with and without known diabetes admitted to our hospital for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI. Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus was defined as HbA1c of 48 mmol/l or greater and pre-diabetes mellitus was defined as HbA1c between 39 and 47 mmol/l. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at short (30 days) and long-term (median 52 months) follow-up. Results: Out of 7900 acute myocardial infarction patients studied, 1314 patients (17%) were known diabetes patients. Of the 6586 patients without known diabetes, 3977 (60%) had no diabetes, 2259 (34%) had pre-diabetes and 350 (5%) had newly diagnosed diabetes based on HbA1c on admission. Both short-term (3.9% vs. 7.4% vs. 6.0%, p<0.001) and long-term mortality (19% vs. 26% vs. 35%, p<0.001) for both pre-diabetes patients as well as newly diagnosed diabetes patients was poor and comparable to known diabetes patients. After multivariate analysis, newly diagnosed diabetes was independently associated with long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.34, P=0.001). Conclusions: In the largest study to date, newly diagnosed or pre-diabetes was present in 33% of acute myocardial infarction patients and was associated with poor long-term clinical outcome. Newly diagnosed diabetes (HbA1c ⩾48 mmol/mol) is an independent predictor of long-term mortality. More attention to early detection of diabetic status and initiation of blood glucose-lowering treatment is necessary."
15955390,Hiltunen 2005,diabetes research and clinical practice,"The aim of this study was to determine the 10-year mortality rate of an elderly population aged 70 years or over (n=379) with reference to glucose tolerance status, taking into account other determinants of excess mortality. The baseline examination during 1991-1992 included a postal questionnaire, a physical examination and a 2h OGTT, which was classified according to both the 1985 WHO criteria and the 1999 WHO criteria. Follow-up was continued until death or until 31 December 2001. 66% of men and 51% of women died within 10 years. In men, the cumulative mortalities were 84% for previously diagnosed diabetes, 67% for undiagnosed diabetes, 67% for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 60% for normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The corresponding percentages for women were 76, 52, 49, and 40%. Male gender, poor self-rated health and previously diagnosed diabetes were the most powerful predictors of mortality. When adjustments were made for age, gender, BMI, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, physical exercise and self-rated health, the estimated relative mortality rate was 2.0 (95% CI 1.5-2.7) among previously diagnosed diabetic subjects, 1.3 (CI 0.8-2.2) among undiagnosed diabetic subjects and 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among IGT subjects compared to NGT subjects. These relative mortalities were higher in women than in men. When abnormal glucose tolerance was pooled into one category, the OR for excess mortality was 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.9)."
12750769,Hu 2003,diabetologia,"AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetic women generally have a greater relative risk of cardiovascular diseases than diabetic men in comparison with non-diabetic women and men. Reasons for this excess risk in diabetic women is still unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the association between different degrees of hyperglycaemia and the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality is different in women and men. METHODS: We analysed baseline glucose concentrations from 14 prospective European cohorts including 8172 men and 9407 women aged 30 to 89 years without history of diabetes, with a median follow-up of 8.3 years. Hazards ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were estimated adjusting for other risk factors. RESULTS: The mortality rates for all-cause and cardiovascular diseases were higher in men than in women in normoglycaemia, impaired glucose regulation and newly-diagnosed diabetes; the largest sex differential for cardiovascular mortality was in normoglycaemic people. The hazards ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were higher in newly diagnosed diabetic women than men compared with normoglycaemic women and men, respectively; however, this sex difference was only significant for cardiovascular mortality. For smokers and for subjects with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or who where overweight, the hazards ratios for cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients compared with normoglycaemic people were also higher in women than in men. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Newly diagnosed diabetic women showed higher relative risks for death from cardiovascular disease than diabetic men. Thus a more aggressive control of hyperglycaemia as well as of other cardiovascular risk factors might be appropriate in women with asymptomatic hyperglycaemia."
31591089,Hubbard 2019,diabetes care,"Objective: Recent studies have suggested that prediabetes is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) only among individuals with concomitant hypertension. Research design and methods: We analyzed the association between prediabetes and CVD by hypertension status among 3,313 black adults in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) without diabetes or a history of CVD at baseline (2000-2004). Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL or hemoglobin A 1c between 5.7 and 6.4% (39 and 46 mmol/mol). Hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg and/or self-reported antihypertensive medication use. Participants were followed for incident CVD events and all-cause mortality through 31 December 2014. Results: Overall, 35% of JHS participants did not have prediabetes or hypertension, 18% had prediabetes alone, 22% had hypertension alone, and 25% had both prediabetes and hypertension. Compared with participants without either condition, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for CVD events among participants with prediabetes alone, hypertension alone, and both prediabetes and hypertension were 0.86 (95% CI 0.51, 1.45), 2.09 (1.39, 3.14), and 1.93 (1.28, 2.90), respectively. Among participants with and without hypertension, there was no association between prediabetes and an increased risk for CVD (0.78 [0.46, 1.34] and 0.94 [0.70, 1.26], respectively). No association was present between prediabetes and all-cause mortality among participants with or without hypertension. Conclusions: Regardless of hypertension status, prediabetes was not associated with an increased risk for CVD or all-cause mortality in this cohort of black adults."
15326061,Hunt 2004,circulation,"BACKGROUND: To assess the utility of clinical definitions of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) to identify individuals with increased cardiovascular risk, we examined the relation between the MetS, using both the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and the World Health Organization definitions, and all cause and cardiovascular mortality in San Antonio Heart Study participants enrolled between 1984 and 1988. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 2815 participants, 25 to 64 years of age at enrollment, 509 met both criteria, 197 met NCEP criteria only, and 199 met WHO criteria only. Over an average of 12.7 years, 229 deaths occurred (117 from cardiovascular disease). Moreover, in the primary prevention population of 2372 participants (ie, those without diabetes or cardiovascular disease at baseline), 132 deaths occurred (50 from cardiovascular disease). In the primary prevention population, the only significant association adjusted for age, gender, and ethnic group was between NCEP-MetS and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.01; 95% CI, 1.13-3.57). In the general population, all cause mortality HRs were 1.47 (95% CI, 1.13-1.92) for NCEP-MetS and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.97-1.66) for WHO-MetS. Furthermore, for cardiovascular mortality, there was evidence that gender modified the predictive ability of the MetS. For women and men, respectively, HRs for NCEP-MetS were 4.65 (95% CI, 2.35-9.21) and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.14-2.91), whereas HRs for WHO-MetS were 2.83 (95% CI, 1.55-5.17) and 1.15 (95% CI, 0.72-1.86). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, although both definitions were predictive in the general population, the simpler NCEP definition tended to be more predictive in lower-risk subjects."
19286584,Hyvarinen 2009,stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the impact of hyperglycemia on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence comparing criteria based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour plasma glucose (2-hour PG). METHODS: Data from 9 European cohorts comprising 18 360 individuals between 25 to 90 years of age were collaboratively analyzed. The maximum length of follow-up varied between 4.9 to 36.8 years. Hazards ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stroke incidence were estimated using Cox-proportional hazards model adjusting for known risk factors. RESULTS: In individuals without a prior history of diabetes, the multivariate adjusted hazards ratio for ischemic stroke corresponding to 1 SD increase in FPG was 1.12 (1.02 to 1.22) and in 2-hour PG 1.14 (1.05 to 1.24). Adding 2-hour PG to the model with FPG significantly improved the prediction of the model for the incidence of ischemic stroke (chi(2)=4.72, P=0.03), whereas FPG did not improve the 2-hour PG model prediction (chi(2)=0.25, P=0.62). A significantly increased hazard ratio was also observed for previously diagnosed diabetes (2.26 [1.51 to 3.38]) and for screen-detected diabetes defined by FPG (1.48 [1.08 to 2.02]) and 2-hour PG (1.60 [1.18 to 2.16]). None of the criteria predicted hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes defined by either of the criteria predicted the future risk of ischemic stroke but not the hemorrhagic stroke. The prediction is stronger for elevated 2-hour PG than for FPG levels."
22413776,Intzilakis 2012,diabetic medicine,"Aim: As both impaired fasting glucose and silent myocardial ischaemia are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and death, we hypothesized that these risk factors in combination would identify those subjects at the highest risk of adverse events. Methods: Healthy individuals without diabetes (n=596, 55-75 years) were examined for silent myocardial infarction (≥ 1 mm ST-interval during ≥ 1 min) by ambulant 48-h continuous electrocardiogram monitoring and impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l). Results: After 6.3 years, 77 subjects met the endpoint of myocardial infarction and/or death. The prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia at inclusion was 12.3% in subjects with impaired fasting glucose and 11.7% in subjects with normal fasting glucose, P=0.69. Subjects with impaired fasting glucose/silent myocardial ischaemia more often met the endpoint (36%) than subjects with impaired fasting glucose/no silent myocardial ischaemia (15%), subjects with normal fasting glucose/silent myocardial ischaemia (12%), and subjects with normal fasting glucose/no silent myocardial ischaemia (10%), respectively, (P<0.001). In a Cox model including these four study groups of interest, gender, age, smoking habits, blood pressure and total cholesterol, only subjects with impaired fasting glucose/silent myocardial ischaemia exhibited an increased risk of death or myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 2.5, P=0.016). Conclusion: The combination of impaired fasting glucose and silent myocardial ischaemia was associated with the poorest prognosis in middle-aged and older subjects without previously known glucose metabolic aberration and heart disease."
19019187,Janszky 2009,journal of internal medicine,"Objectives: Our objective was to examine fasting glucose and insulin levels in patients surviving 3 months after a first AMI in relation to long-term prognosis. Design: A total of 1167 consecutive patients between 45 and 70 years with a first nonfatal AMI underwent a standardized clinical examination and were followed for a mean of 8 years for total and cardiac mortality and hospitalization for nonfatal cardiovascular disease. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was defined as fasting glucose between 5.6 and 7 mmol L(-1) and a level >or=7 mmol L(-1) as newly detected diabetes. Patients with a fasting glucose level <5.6 mmol L(-1) and without a history of diabetes were classified as normoglycemic (NG). An estimate of insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Results: We recorded 219 deaths, 121 deaths from cardiac causes, during the follow-up period. After adjustment for several potential confounders, hazard ratios for total mortality were 1.36 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.99, P=0.11), 2.27 (1.26-4.09, P=0.006) and 2.15 (1.43-3.21, P<0.001) for patients with IFG, newly detected diabetes and history of diabetes when compared to the NG group. Cardiac mortality, risk of hospitalization for recurrent nonfatal AMI, stroke or heart failure generally showed a similar pattern to that of total mortality. Insulin level and HOMA values were also associated with increased risk for recurrent events. Conclusions: We confirmed that both known and newly detected diabetes is a strong prognostic factor in AMI. In addition, our findings suggest that glucose levels below the diabetes cut off value might also predict poor long-term prognosis when assessed in a metabolically stable phase."
31679008,Jiang 2020,journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,"Context: China has the largest number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the world. Data from previous studies have suggested that up to one-fifth of individuals with diabetes would be missed without an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). To date, there is little information on the mortality risk of these individuals. Objective: We estimated the association of different indicators of hyperglycemia with mortality in the general Chinese population. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: China. Participants: A total of 17 939 participants aged 50+ years. Exposures: Previously diagnosed diabetes and newly detected diabetes defined by fasting glucose (≥7.0 mmol/L), 2-hour postload glucose (≥11.1 mmol/L), or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, ≥6.5%). Main outcomes measures: Deaths from all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer were identified by record linkage with death registration. Results: During 7.8 (SD, 1.5) years' follow-up, 1439 deaths were recorded. Of 3706 participants with T2DM, 2126 (57%) had known T2DM, 118 (3%) were identified by isolated elevated fasting glucose, 1022 (28%) had isolated elevated postload glucose, and 440 (12%) had both elevated fasting and postload glucose. Compared with normoglycemia, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of all-cause mortality was 1.71 (1.46-2.00), 0.96 (0.47-1.93), 1.43 (1.15-1.78), and 1.82 (1.35-2.45) for the 4 groups, respectively. T2DM defined by elevated HbA1c was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.69). Conclusion: Individuals with isolated higher 2-h postload glucose had a higher risk of mortality by 43% than those with normoglycemia. Underuse of OGTT leads to substantial underdetection of individuals with a higher mortality risk and lost opportunities for early intervention."
16943263,Kaarisalo 2006,age and ageing,"OBJECTIVE: to determine whether impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is associated with an increased likelihood for ischaemic stroke. DESIGN: prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: a sample of 1,032 non-institutionalised people aged 70 years in the Turku Elderly Study, Turku, Finland. MEASUREMENTS: the association between IGT (defined as plasma glucose level between 7.80 and 11.09 mmol/l 2 h after administration of 75 g of an oral glucose load) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (defined as the current use of insulin or an oral hypoglycaemic medication, a fasting plasma glucose level of >/=7 mmol/l or a plasma glucose level of >/=11.1 mmol/l 2 h after administration of an oral glucose load) with 12-year follow-up for the development of ischaemic stroke. RESULTS: a total of 742 (71.9%) subjects had normal glucose tolerance, 127 (12.3%) subjects had IGT and 163 (15.8%) had DM. Patients were examined in the year 1990 and followed up for stroke occurrence until death or until the end of 2002. Mean follow-up time was 9.6 years (SD +/ 3.3 years). In total, 119 patients (11.5%) suffered a stroke during the follow up. In logistic regression model, previous stroke, previous TIA, DM and atrial fibrillation were risk factors for stroke occurrence. CONCLUSION: stroke tended to happen more often in the IGT group than in the normal group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Statistically significant risk factors for stroke in elderly people are previous TIA or stroke, DM and atrial fibrillation."
15677800,Kanaya 2005,diabetes care,"Objective: To create a simple prediction rule that could perform as well as the 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose (PCPG) test to predict those at risk for diabetes. We created a prediction rule in one sample and prospectively validated it for incident diabetes in a separate cohort. Research design and methods: A cross-sectional analysis with data from the Rancho Bernardo Study (age 67 +/- 11 years) to derive a rule predicting abnormal PCPG >/=140 mg/dl, using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of nondiabetic participants with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <126 mg/dl. Data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition study (age 74 +/- 3 years) were used to prospectively validate this rule for incident diabetes and compare it with the predictive ability of the PCPG test. Results: Of 1,549 RBS participants, 514 (33%) had PCPG >/=140 mg/dl. Female sex, age, triglycerides, and FPG were most significantly associated with abnormal PCPG. Based on standardized beta-coefficients, we allotted 1 point for female sex, triglycerides >/=150 mg/dl, or FPG 95-104 mg/dl. Age >/=70 years or FPG 105-115 mg/dl were given 2 points, and FPG 116-125 mg/dl received 3 points. In the validation cohort, this simple prediction rule was as good as the 2-h PCPG test for predicting incident diabetes (C-statistic: 0.71 for both). Conclusions: Advanced age, female sex, FPG, and triglycerides were able to predict adults at risk for diabetes equally well as the 2-h PCPG test. Using this rule, clinicians may better identify older persons who should receive intensive lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes."
20940070,Khang 2010,atherosclerosis,"OBJECTIVE: We examined the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes with the metabolic syndrome according to the new harmonised definition and its components using a national longitudinal data set from an Asian population. METHODS: Data of 9791 men and women aged 20+ from 1998 and 2001 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were individually linked to national hospitalisation and mortality data using unique personal identification numbers. During a 5.8-year follow-up through 2005, 288 incident cardiovascular events (184 strokes and 122 cases of ischaemic heart disease) and 85 new diabetes cases have been detected. RESULTS: Men and women with the metabolic syndrome had 48%, 39%, 64%, and 127% greater risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes, respectively, than those without the metabolic syndrome. The increased risks of cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes remained significant after adjusting for health behaviours, bio-clinical factors, family history, and socio-demographic factors. Analysis results on population attributable risks showed that about a quarter of total diabetes occurrence and more than 10% of cardiovascular disease was attributable to the metabolic syndrome. The number of metabolic syndrome components was linearly associated with risks of outcomes. High blood pressure was significantly associated with all four outcomes while hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia were also important for ischaemic heart disease and diabetes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of metabolic risk factors is necessary in South Korea to lower the burden of associated diseases, especially ever-increasing ischaemic heart disease and diabetes."
27334522,Khosravi 2017,journal of human hypertension,"The present study aimed to assess the value of pre-diabetes and pre-hypertension in predicting cardiovascular events. A population-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted, representing a large sample of the general Iranian population aged 35 years and older from the Isfahan Province and determined using a random, multistage cluster-sampling 10-year cohort. The five end points considered as study outcome were unstable angina (UA), acute occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death (SCD), brain stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Of the 6323 subjects scheduled for assessment of diabetes state 617 were diabetics and 712 were pre-diabetic. In addition, of these subjects, 1754 had hypertension and 2500 had pre-hypertension. Analysing only pre-hypertension, pre-diabetes and its combination and adjusted for gender and age variables, pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes status together, could only effectively predict occurrence of MI (hazard ratio (HR)=3.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-9.76, P=0.04). In the same COX regression models, pre-hypertension status could predict UA and CVD occurrence (HR=2.94, 95% CI: 1.68-5.14, P<0.001 and HR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.23-2.47, P=0.002, respectively). However, pre-diabetes status could not predict any of these events after adjustment for gender and age. Our data provide valuable evidence of the triggering role of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together, on appearance and progression of MI even in healthy individuals and the significant predicting value of pre-hypertension on the occurrence of UA and CVD. In this regard, the value of pre-hypertension and pre-diabetes together, and the pre-hypertension state alone, are clearly superior to pre-diabetes state alone in predicting cardiovascular events."
18071000,Kim 2008,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are associated with increased risk of mortality and prevalent ischemic heart disease (IHD) and to analyze if the increased risk of death is dependent on subsequent development of diabetes in Pima Indians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2,993 Pima Indians aged >or=35 years were included. Prevalent IHD, defined by major ischemic electrocardiogram changes, was evaluated according to the following glucose/diabetes categories: normal glucose regulation (NGR), IFG and/or IGT, and diabetic groups by duration. During a median follow-up of 10.4 years, 780 subjects died from natural causes and 156 of these died from IHD. Mortality was analyzed according to the same glucose/diabetes categories at baseline and then as time-dependent variables. RESULTS: Only subjects with diabetes >or=15 years of duration have a higher prevalence of IHD (odds ratio 1.9 [95% CI 1.4-2.5]) relative to NGR. In baseline and time-dependent models, age- and sex-adjusted death rates from natural causes and from IHD were similar among the nondiabetic groups. Among diabetic subjects, natural mortality was higher in those with >or=15 years diabetes duration (death rate ratio [DRR] relative to NGR = 2.6 [95% CI 2.1-3.3]). IHD mortality was higher in subjects with long diabetes duration (DRR for diabetes 10-15 years = 3.8 [1.5-9.5]; DRR for diabetes >or=15 years = 8.6 [3.8-19.4]) in the time dependent model. CONCLUSIONS: Natural and IHD mortality are not increased in Pima Indians with IFG and/or IGT. Only after the onset of diabetes do the rates of these events increase relative to NGR."
23002083,Kim 2013,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: The relationship between impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or ischemic heart disease (IHD) varies widely according to sex and ethnicity. We evaluated the relationship between IFG and CVD or IHD among Korean men and women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 408,022 individuals who underwent voluntary private health examinations in 17 centers in South Korea were followed for 10 years. Data regarding CVD or IHD events were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance database. IFG was categorized as grade 1 (fasting glucose 100-109 mg/dL) or grade 2 (110-125 mg/dL). RESULTS: Incidence rates of CVD (per 100,000 person-years) were 2,203 for diabetes. Age-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD were 1.17 (95% CI 1.13-1.20) for grade 1 IFG, 1.30 (1.24-1.35) for grade 2 IFG, and 1.81 (1.75-1.86) for diabetes. The increased risk for women was similar to that of men. Age-adjusted HRs for IHD and ischemic stroke were also significantly increased for men and women with IFG and diabetes. After multivariate adjustment of conventional risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity, and family history of CVD), the overall risk of CVD was greatly attenuated in all categories. However, the HRs for IHD and ischemic stroke remained significantly increased in men for grade 2 IFG but not in women. CONCLUSIONS: In Korea, grade 2 IFG is associated with increased risk of IHD and ischemic stroke, independent of other conventional risk factors, in men but not in women."
24627827,Kim 2014,diabetes & metabolism journal,"Background: Although diabetes is a well-known risk factor for death, its impact on cancer death is not clearly understood. Furthermore, it remains controversial whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are associated with increased risk of mortality. We investigated the impact of diabetes or glucose tolerance categories on all cause and cause-specific mortality. Methods: Mortality analysis was conducted in three population-based cohort studies of 3,801 participants, divided according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (normal; stage 1 IFG [5.6≤FPG<6.1 mmol/L]; stage 2 IFG [6.1≤FPG<7.0 mmol/L]; diabetes mellitus [DM]-FPG); or 2-hour glucose after 75 g glucose loading (2hPG) (normal; IGT; DM-2hPG), or a combination of FPG and 2hPG criteria. Results: During a median follow-up of 11.0 years, 474 subjects died from all causes. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all cause death were higher in those with diabetes as defined by either FPG or 2hPG criteria than their normal counterparts (HR, 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 2.9 for DM-FPG; HR, 2.0, 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.7 for DM-2hPG). Similarly, diabetes defined by either FPG or 2hPG was associated with cancer death (HR, 2.9, 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.0; and HR, 2.1, 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.9, respectively). Although neither IFG nor IGT conferred higher risk for death, when combining stage 2 IFG and/or IGT, the risk of all cause death was higher than in subjects with normal glucose regulation (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6). Conclusion: Diabetes is associated with higher risk of death from all causes and cancer. In subjects without diabetes, stage 2 IFG and/or IGT confers increased risk for mortality."
26355268,Kim 2016,journal of diabetes,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare the association between cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and prediabetes defined by either fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, or their combination in a Korean population. METHODS: In all, 76 434 South Koreans who voluntarily underwent a general health examination in the Health Screening & Promotion Center (Asan Medical Center) were analyzed after excluding patients with a previous history of CVD. Cardiovascular events and death due to CVD during a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (interquartile range 1.9-4.3 years) were identified from the Nationwide Health Insurance Claims Database and death certificates using ICD-10 codes. RESULTS: Age- and sex adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for overall CVD events were significantly greater for subjects with prediabetes defined by FPG only (HR 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.31), HbA1c only (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.16-1.42), and combined criteria (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.32) compared with the normoglycemic group. After adjusting for multiple conventional risk factors (e.g. hypertension, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status, family history of CVD, and BMI), the HRs for overall CVD were significantly increased only for participants with prediabetes defined by HbA1c. Age- and sex adjusted HRs for major ischemic heart disease events were significantly increased for subjects with prediabetes defined either by HbA1c or combined criteria. Similarly, age- and sex-adjusted HRs for percutaneous coronary intervention were significantly higher for subjects with prediabetes defined by HbA1c only. For diabetes, the multivariate-adjusted HRs for all outcomes were significantly increased by all three criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Adding an HbA1c criterion when defining prediabetes in Koreans can help identify individuals with an increased risk of CVD."
28258257,Kim 2017,stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prediabetes is a known risk factor for vascular diseases; however, its differential contribution to mortality risk from various vascular disease subtypes is not known. METHODS: The subjects of the National Health Insurance Service in Korea (2002-2013) nationwide cohort were stratified into normal glucose tolerance (fasting glucose <100 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) stage 1 (100-109 mg/dL), IFG stage 2 (110-125 mg/dL), and diabetes mellitus groups based on the fasting glucose level. A Cox regression analysis with counting process formulation was used to assess the mortality risk for vascular disease and its subtypes-ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. RESULTS: When adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index, IFG stage 2, but not stage 1, was associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.34) and vascular disease mortality (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.08-1.49) compared with normal glucose tolerance. Among the vascular disease subtypes, mortality from ischemic stroke was significantly higher (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.18-2.18) in subjects with IFG stage 2 but not from ischemic heart disease and hemorrhagic stroke. The ischemic stroke mortality associated with IFG stage 2 remained significantly high when adjusted other modifiable vascular disease risk factors (HR, 1.51; 95% CI: 1.10-2.09) and medical treatments (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.19-2.57). CONCLUSIONS: Higher IFG degree (fasting glucose, 110-125 mg/dL) was associated with increased all-cause and vascular disease mortality. The increased vascular disease mortality in IFG stage 2 was attributable to ischemic stroke, but not ischemic heart disease or hemorrhagic stroke in Korean adults."
30992067,Kim 2019,bmc nephrology,"Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical impact of prediabetes on the development of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a Korean adult population, using data from the Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 7728 Korean adults without baseline CKD and type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes was defined by impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and HbA1C level. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. We assessed the predictive value of prediabetes for the incidence of CKD, and investigated the incidence of cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease and stroke. Results: Over a median follow-up period of 8.7 years, 871 of 7728 (11.3%) subjects developed incident CKD. Patients with prediabetes, as defined by IGT or HbA1C, developed incident CKD more frequently than the non-prediabetic group did. The risk of CKD development at follow-up was analyzed according to different prediabetes definitions. Compared with the non-prediabetic group, the IGT- (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.135, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.182-1.310, P = 0.043) and HbA1C-defined prediabetic groups (HR = 1.391, 95% CI = 1.213-1.595, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with incident CKD after adjusting for traditional CKD risk factors; however, IFG was not associated with incident CKD. Conclusion: IGT- or HbA1C-defined prediabetes is an independent predictor of incident CKD. The measurement of these parameters might enable early detection of CKD risk, allowing physicians to initiate preventive measures and improve patient outcomes."
20927111,Kokubo 2010,hypertension research,"Few prospective studies have examined the combined impact of blood pressure (BP) categories and glucose abnormalities on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general Asian population. This study aimed to examine the effect of the combined risks of these factors on the incidence of CVD in a general Japanese population. We studied 5321 Japanese individuals (aged 30-79 years), without CVD at baseline, who received follow-up for an average of 11.7 years. Serum fasting glucose categories were defined according to the 2003 American Diabetes Association recommendations. BP categories were defined by the 2009 Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension. The Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD according to the serum glucose and BP categories were calculated. In 62,036 person-years of follow-up, we documented 364 CVD events (198 stroke and 166 coronary heart disease (CHD)). Compared with normoglycemic subjects, the multivariable HRs (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for CVD, CHD and stroke were 1.25 (1.00-1.58), 1.46 (1.04-2.04) and 1.11 (0.81 1.52), respectively, in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), whereas these values were 2.13 (1.50-3.03), 2.28 (1.34-3.88) and 2.08 (1.29-3.35), respectively, in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM). Compared with normoglycemic and optimal blood pressure (BP) subjects, increased risks of CVD were observed in the normoglycemic subjects with high-normal BP or hypertension, the IFG subjects with normal or higher BP, and the DM subjects regardless of BP category (P-value for interaction=0.046). In conclusion, the high-normal BP subjects in all glucose categories and the normal BP subjects with IFG showed increased risk of CVD in this Japanese population. Further investigation of larger cohorts of DM subjects should be conducted to better understand this phenomenon."
21785986,Kowall 2011,european journal of epidemiology,"We investigated the association of undiagnosed diabetes, previously known diabetes and prediabetes (WHO 1999 classification) with all-cause and cause specific mortality in an older German population. Previous study results for mortality in patients with very low levels of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) are still inconclusive. Thus we have extended the analyses to continuous measures of glycemia. A total of 1,466 subjects aged 55-74 years from the population-based KORA survey S4 (conducted from 1999 to 2001) were included in our observational mortality study (152 subjects with previously known diabetes, and 1,314 further subjects who underwent oral glucose tolerance tests). Mortality was followed up for a maximum of 10.0 years (median follow-up 8.8 years). A total of 180 (12.3%) of the 1,466 subjects have died during the follow-up period. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 2.6 (95%CI, 1.7-3.8) for known diabetes, 2.8 (95%CI, 1.7-4.4) for undiagnosed diabetes, and 1.1 (95%CI, 0.8-1.7) for prediabetes [reference: normal glucose tolerance (NGT)]. After multivariable adjustment, undiagnosed diabetes was associated with 3.0-fold increased cancer mortality, 1.1 fold increased cardiovascular mortality, and 4.7-fold increased non-cancer, non cardiovascular mortality compared with NGT. For HbA1c, FPG, and 2hPG, J-shaped associations with all-cause mortality were observed. Undiagnosed diabetes is associated with increased all-cause, cancer, and non-cancer non-cardiovascular mortality, but not with cardiovascular mortality in this older population. All cause mortality in undiagnosed diabetes is similar to that in previously known diabetes but much higher than mortality in prediabetes and NGT."
23248190,Laukkanen 2013,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and type 2 diabetes may be risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study was based on 2,641 middle-aged men 42-60 years of age at baseline. Impaired FPG level (>=5.6 mmol/L) among nondiabetic subjects (501 men) was defined according to the established guidelines, and the group with type 2 diabetes included subjects (159 men) who were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin therapy, and/or diet. RESULTS: During the 19-year follow-up, a total of 190 SCDs occurred. The relative risk (RR) for SCD was 1.51-fold (95% CI 1.07-2.14, P = 0.020) for nondiabetic men with impaired FPG and 2.86-fold (1.87-4.38, P < 0.001) for men with type 2 diabetes as compared with men with normal FPG levels, after adjustment for age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, serum LDL cholesterol, smoking, prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), and family history of CHD. The respective RRs for out-of hospital SCDs (157 deaths) were 1.79-fold (1.24-2.58, P = 0.001) for nondiabetic men with impaired FPG and 2.26-fold (1.34-3.77, P < 0.001) for men with type 2 diabetes. Impaired FPG and type 2 diabetes were associated with the risk of all cause death. As a continuous variable, a 1 mmol/L increment in FPG was related to an increase of 10% in the risk of SCD (1.10 [1.04-1.20], P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired FPG and type 2 diabetes represent risk factors for SCD."
32181918,Lazo-Porras 2020,diabetic medicine,"Aim: To determine whether intermediate hyperglycaemia, defined by fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c criteria, is associated with mortality in a 10-year cohort of people in a Latin American country. Methods: Analysis of the PERU MIGRANT Study was conducted in three different population groups (rural, rural-to-urban migrant, and urban). The baseline assessment was conducted in 2007/2008, with follow-up assessment in 2018. The outcome was all-cause mortality, and the exposure was intermediate hyperglycaemia, using three definitions: (1) impaired fasting glucose, defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria [fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l (100-125 mg/dl)]; (2) intermediate hyperglycaemia defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria [HbA1c levels 39-46 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%)]; and (3) intermediate hyperglycaemia defined according to the International Expert Committee criteria [HbA1c levels 42-46 mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%)]. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. Results: At baseline, the mean (sd) age of the study population was 47.8 (11.9) years and 52.5% of the cohort were women. The study cohort was divided into population groups as follows: 207 people (20.0%) in the rural population group, 583 (59.7%) in the rural-to-urban migrant group and 198 (20.3%) in the urban population group. The prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia was: 6%, 12.9% and 38.5% according to the American Diabetes Association impaired fasting glucose definition, the International Expert Committee HbA1c -based definition and the American Diabetes Association HbA1c -based definition, respectively, and the mortality rate after 10 years was 63/976 (7%). Intermediate hyperglycaemia was associated with all-cause mortality using the HbA1c -based definitions in the crude models [hazard ratios 2.82 (95% CI 1.59-4.99) according to the American Diabetes Association and 2.92 (95% CI 1.62-5.28) according to the International Expert Committee], whereas American Diabetes Association-defined impaired fasting glucose was not [hazard ratio 0.84 (95% CI 0.26-2.68)]. In the adjusted model, however, only the American Diabetes Association HbA1c -based definition was associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 1.91 (95% CI 1.03-3.53)], whereas the International Expert Committee HbA1c -based and American Diabetes Association impaired fasting glucose-based definitions were not [hazard ratios 1.42 (95% CI 0.75-2.68) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.33-3.63), respectively]. Conclusions: Intermediate hyperglycaemia defined using the American Diabetes Association HbA1c criteria was associated with an elevated mortality rate after 10 years in a cohort from Peru. HbA1c appears to be a factor associated with mortality in this Peruvian population."
18206734,Levitzky 2008,journal of the american college of cardiology,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. BACKGROUND: It is unclear which glucose threshold should define prediabetes. We compared the 1997 and 2003 American Diabetes Association (ADA) definitions of IFG to predict CVD. METHODS: Framingham offspring participants free of CVD, categorized by the 1997 ADA IFG definition (fasting plasma glucose 110 to 125 mg/dl; 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l) or the 2003 definition (100 to 125 mg/dl; 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/l), were followed from 1983 to 2004. Pooled logistic regression was used to calculate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident coronary heart disease (CHD; 291 events) or CVD (423 events). RESULTS: Four-year CHD event rates among women were 1.3% (100 to 109 mg/dl), 2.3% (110 to 125 mg/dl), and 2.9% (diabetes); whereas corresponding rates in men were 2.9%, 3.0%, and 8.7%. For the 2003 IFG definition, the OR for CHD among women was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 3.0, p = 0.048), whereas for the 1997 IFG definition, the OR for CHD in women was 2.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 4.4, p = 0.02), which was almost as high as for women with diabetes (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.2, p = 0.01). For CVD, only the 1997 IFG definition yielded significantly greater odds of CVD in women (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.6, p = 0.01). Men were not at increased odds of developing CVD or CHD by either definition. CONCLUSIONS: In women, both IFG definitions were associated with increased CHD risk, whereas neither IFG definition identified men at increased short-term risk for CHD or CVD. The finding that women with FPG 110 to 125 mg/dl had similar CHD risk compared with women with diabetes suggests that CHD risk in women may be elevated at a lower glucose level than for men."
17383293,Liu 2007,american heart journal,"BACKGROUND: The relative contributions of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and dysglycemia on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have not been dissected. We aimed to compare MetS with dysglycemia in their association with the 10-year incidence risk of CVD. METHODS: A total of 30,378 subjects were recruited from 11 provinces in the CMCS and followed-up for new coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke events (ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke) for 10 years. Incidence rates and HRs were estimated by the presence or absence of MetS, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes, and by the various traits of MetS. RESULTS: Among the subjects, 18.2% were defined as having MetS; 21.1% had IFG, and 6.8% had diabetes. Metabolic syndrome prevalence in IFG and diabetes was 38.1% and 48.7%, respectively, and the prevalence of IFG and diabetes in MetS was 44.1% and 18.3%, respectively. After adjusting for nonmetabolic risk factors, HRs of total CVD, CHD, and ischemic stroke in MetS were significant and higher than those in non MetS, regardless of glycemic status. In the absence of MetS, the impact of dysglycemia was found only in IFG to CHD and diabetes to ischemic stroke. Hyperglycemia without any concomitant disorders was not associated with significantly higher risk of CVD. CONCLUSIONS: The increased CVD risk in individuals with IFG or diabetes was largely driven by the coexistence of multiple metabolic disorders rather than hyperglycemia per se. Identification of clustering of metabolic abnormalities should be given more consideration in CVD prevention."
29669793,Liu 2018,hypertension,"Whether prediabetes mellitus (Pre-DM) alone or combined with hypertension is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease has not been fully clarified. This study aimed to further confirm whether the relation of Pre-DM to cardiovascular disease differs between individuals with or without hypertension. A total of 7121 consecutive patients with angina-like chest pain who received coronary angiography were evaluated and 4193 patients with angiography-proven stable, new-onset coronary artery disease were enrolled into the study. They were divided into 3 groups according to diabetes mellitus status and further stratified by hypertension. The severity of coronary artery disease was assessed by number of diseased vessels and Gensini score. All subjects were regularly followed up for the occurrence of the composite end points. Comparisons of coronary artery disease severity and outcomes were performed among these groups. During an average of 11 338 patient-years of follow-up, 434 (10.35%) cardiovascular events occurred. No significant difference was observed in coronary severity and composite end point events between Pre-DM and normal glucose regulation groups (both P>0.05). However, when hypertension was also incorporated as a stratifying factor, cardiovascular disease risk, assessed by coronary severity and clinical prognosis, was significantly elevated in Pre-DM plus hypertension and diabetes mellitus plus hypertension groups, compared with the reference group with normal glucose regulation and normal blood pressure (all P<0.05). The present study indicated that among patients with stable, new-onset coronary artery disease, the increased cardiovascular risk with Pre-DM is largely driven by the coexistence of hypertension rather than Pre-DM per se."
12604162,Lu 2003,annals of epidemiology,"PURPOSE: To assess the effects of isolated post-challenge hyperglycemia (IPH) on risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and all-cause mortality in American Indians using longitudinal data from the Strong Heart Study. METHODS: Of 4549 American Indian women and men aged 45 to 74 years participating in the Strong Heart Study, 4304 had fasting blood measurements or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) data to ascertain diabetes status. At baseline and follow-up, a personal interview was conducted, and physical examinations and laboratory tests were performed. Fasting blood samples were drawn for measurement of glucose, fibrinogen, insulin, lipids, lipoproteins, creatinine, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). A 75-g OGTT was performed. Five diabetes categories were defined: (i) known diabetes, (ii) newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose > or =126 mg/dL and no history of diabetes or diabetes medication; ADA-new diabetes), (iii) IPH, (iv) impaired fasting glucose (> or =110 - <126 mg/dL; IFG), and (v) normal fasting glucose (<110 mg/dL; NFG). Surveillance was initiated to determine CVD, cancer, and all-cause mortality over 9 years. RESULTS: IPH had a worse CVD risk factor profile than NFG, but IPH was associated with a better CVD risk factor profile than known diabetes or ADA-new diabetes. At follow-up, individuals with IFG had no increased risk for CVD or all-cause mortality, whereas those with ADA new or known diabetes had significantly increased risk (RR = 1.70 and 1.40 for ADA-new diabetes, and RR = 2.87 and 2.19 for known diabetes, respectively). Those with IPH had nonsignificant elevations in risk for CVD (RR = 1.54) and all-cause (RR = 1.27) mortality. Cancer mortality was not increased in those with IFG, IPH, ADA-new diabetes, or known diabetes compared to those with NFG. CONCLUSIONS: Among American Indians 45 to 74 years of age, IPH is associated with nonsignificant elevations in total and CVD mortality. The magnitude of mortality risk associated with IPH is intermediate between diabetes and IFG. Because those with IPH are at high risk for diabetes, American Indians with IPH should be targeted for diabetes prevention."
31152120,Lu 2019,diabetes care,"Objective: Uncertainty remains regarding the predictive value of various glycemic measures as they relate to the risk of diabetes and its complications. Using the cutoffs recommended by the American Diabetes Association's 2010 criteria, we determined the associations of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postload glucose (2h-PG), and HbA1c with the outcomes. Research design and methods: Baseline medical history, FPG, 2h-PG, and HbA1c were obtained from a population-based cohort of 193,846 adults aged ≥40 years in China during 2011-2012. A follow-up visit was conducted during 2014-2016 in order to assess incident diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and mortality. Results: We documented 8,063 cases of diabetes, 3,014 CVD-related events, 1,624 cases of cancer, and 2,409 deaths during up to 5 years of follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted risk ratios (95% CIs) of diabetes associated with prediabetes based on FPG of 100-125 mg/dL, 2h-PG of 140-199 mg/dL, or HbA1c of 5.7-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol) were 1.60 (1.43-1.79), 2.72 (2.43-3.04), and 1.49 (1.36-1.62), respectively. Restricted cubic spline analyses suggested J-shaped associations of FPG, 2h-PG, and HbA1c levels with CVD, cancer, and mortality. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) associated with untreated diabetes based on FPG ≥126 mg/dL, 2h-PG ≥200 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) were 1.18 (1.05-1.33), 1.31 (1.18-1.45), and 1.20 (1.07-1.34) for CVD; 1.10 (0.92-1.32), 1.44 (1.25-1.67), and 1.08 (0.92-1.28) for cancer; and 1.37 (1.20-1.57), 1.57 (1.41-1.76), and 1.33 (1.17-1.52) for mortality, respectively. 2h-PG remained significantly associated with outcomes in models including FPG and HbA1c as spline terms. Furthermore, 2h-PG significantly improved the ability of the C statistic to predict diabetes, CVD, and mortality. Conclusions: 2h-PG remains independently predictive of outcomes in models including FPG and HbA1c. Therefore, in addition to FPG and HbA1c, routine testing of 2h-PG should be considered in order to better assess the risks of outcomes."
12965880,Ma 2003,american journal of epidemiology,"Despite the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, little is known about mortality associated with diabetes in Asia. Therefore, the authors followed 3,492 Chinese, Malay, and Asian Indian adults randomly selected from the general population in Singapore. Data on glucose tolerance, demographic characteristics, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors (lipid profile, blood pressure, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and obesity) were obtained in 1992. Vital status was determined as of December 31, 2001. There were 108 deaths over a period of 9 years. Impaired fasting glycemia or impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT) (hazard ratio (HR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84, 2.31) and diabetes mellitus (HR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.58, 3.94) were associated with increased mortality after adjustment for age, gender, ethnic group, and educational level. Compared with Chinese with diabetes, Indians with diabetes experienced significantly greater mortality (HR=3.86, 95% CI: 1.76, 8.44) after adjustment for gender, age, educational level, smoking, hypertension, alcohol intake, and obesity. Undiagnosed diabetes and IFG/IGT were more common than known diabetes and also were associated with increased mortality. For reduction of mortality associated with IFG/IGT and diabetes, the authors recommend a screening program to detect undiagnosed diabetes and IFG/IGT along with aggressive treatment of diabetes after diagnosis."
23230470,Ma 2012,journal of preventive medicine & public health,"OBJECTIVES: Diabetes and obesity each increases mortality, but recent papers have shown that lean Asian persons were at greater risk for mortality than were obese persons. The objective of this study is to determine whether an interaction exists between body mass index (BMI) and diabetes, which can modify the risk of death by cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Subjects who were over 20 years of age, and who had information regarding BMI, past history of diabetes, and fasting blood glucose levels (n=16 048), were selected from the Korea Multi center Cancer Cohort study participants. By 2008, a total of 1290 participants had died; 251 and 155 had died of CVD and stroke, respectively. The hazard for deaths was calculated with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) by Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Compared with the normal population, patients with diabetes were at higher risk for CVD and stroke deaths (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.56; HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.76; respectively). Relative to subjects with no diabetes and normal BMI (21 to 22.9 kg/m(2)), lean subjects with diabetes (BMI <21 kg/m(2)) had a greater risk for CVD and stroke deaths (HR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.57 to 5.09; HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.58 to 6.76; respectively), while obese subjects with diabetes (BMI >=25 kg/m(2)) had no increased death risk (p interaction <0.05). This pattern was consistent in sub-populations with no incidence of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that diabetes in lean people is more critical to CVD deaths than it is in obese people."
22303857,Madssen 2012,scandinavian cardiovascular journal,"OBJECTIVES: To assess fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) by gender and glucose regulation status. DESIGN: 47,951 people were followed up according to fatal CAD identified in the National Cause of Death Registry. Gender-effects of fatal CAD in people with impaired glucose regulation (IGR), newly diagnosed diabetes (NDM) or known diabetes (KDM) compared with people with normal glucose regulation (NGR) were calculated using Cox regression. RESULTS: Using NGR as reference, the hazard ratios (HR, 95% confidence intervals) associated with IGR was 1.2 (0.8-1.9) for women and 1.2 (0.9-1.6) for men. The corresponding HRs were 1.6 (1.2-2.2) and 1.4 (1.1.-1.9) for NDM, and 2.5 (2.1-2.8) and 1.8 (1.6-2.1) for KDM. The gender difference in mortality varied by category (P(interaction) = 0.003). Using women as the reference, the HRs for men were 2.1 (2.0-2.3) for NGR, 1.8 (1.0-3.3) for IGR, 1.6 (1.0-2.5) for NDM, and 1.2 (1.0-1.5) for KDM. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus, but not IGR, was associated with fatal CAD in both genders. The known gender-difference in CAD mortality was attenuated in people with abnormal glucose regulation, evident already in people with IGR."
20530745,Magliano 2010,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: Little information is available on the impact of abnormal glucose tolerance on mortality in South Asian and African populations in the developing world. We explored this issue in a large, multiethnic cohort from the developing nation of Mauritius. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Population-based surveys were undertaken in 1987, 1992, and 1998. The 9,559 participants (20-82 years old) comprised 66% South Asian (Indian), 27% Creole (African), and 7% Chinese descent. Mortality was ascertained in 2007. RESULTS: Over a median 15.1-year follow-up, 1,557 participants died. Compared with those with normal glucose tolerance, the all-cause mortality hazard ratios (HR) for known diabetes, newly diagnosed diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance were 3.35 (95% CI 2.77-4.04), 2.11 (1.73 2.57), and 1.53 (1.26-1.87) in South Asians and 2.14 (1.65-2.79), 1.41 (1.06 1.88), and 1.08 (0.83-1.40) in Africans, respectively. Those with impaired fasting glucose were not at increased risk in either ethnicity. In the Chinese, only those with known diabetes were at increased risk of mortality with HR 3.68 (1.87-7.25). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in a developing country of the impact of glucose intolerance on mortality in an African population, and one of the first studies of a South Asian population. It shows that the impact on mortality in these populations in Mauritius is comparable to that seen in developed countries. These results are important in a global context for future health policy in light of the impact of the rapid increase in prevalence of diabetes, especially in developing nations."
25500370,Mainous 2014,bmj open,"Objectives: Data have indicated low to non-existent increased mortality risk for individuals with prediabetes, but it is unclear if the risk is increased when the patient has elevated iron markers. Our purpose was to examine the mortality risk among adults with prediabetes in the context of coexisting elevated transferrin saturation (TS) or serum ferritin. Setting: Data collected by the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988-1994 (NHANES III) in the USA and by the National Center for Health Statistics for the National Death Index from 1988 to 2006. Participants: Individuals age 40 and older who participated in the NHANES and provided a blood sample. Primary outcome variable: Mortality was measured as all-cause mortality. Results: Adjusted analyses show that prediabetes has a small increased mortality risk (HR=1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08). Persons who had prediabetes and elevated serum ferritin had an increased HR for death (HR=1.14; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24) compared with those who had normal ferritin and normal glucose. Among persons with prediabetes who had elevated TS, they had an increased mortality risk (HR=1.88; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.30) compared with those with normal TS levels and normal glucose. Conclusions: The mortality risk of prediabetes is low. However, among individuals who have coexisting elevated iron markers, particularly TS, the risk rises substantially."

The utility of pre-diabetes mellitus, diabetes mellitus and other risk factors as predictors of incident angina pectoris among older adults has not been characterized. We examined incident angina pectoris rates by sex and diabetes mellitus status in 4511 adults aged ⩾65 years without coronary heart disease at baseline from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Cox regression examined predictors of incident angina pectoris, including pre-diabetes mellitus or diabetes mellitus adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and other risk factors, over 12.2 ± 6.9 years of follow-up. Overall, 39.1% of participants had pre-diabetes mellitus, 14.0% had diabetes mellitus and 532 (11.8%) had incident angina pectoris. Incident angina pectoris rates per 1000 person-years in those with neither condition, pre-diabetes mellitus, and diabetes mellitus were 7.9, 9.0 and 12.3 in women and 10.3, 11.2 and 14.5 in men, respectively. Pre-diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus were not independently associated with incident AP; however, key predictors of AP were male sex, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication and difficulty performing at least one instrumental activity of daily living (all p < 0.05 to p < 0.01). In our cohort of older adult participants, while the incidence of AP is greater in those with diabetes mellitus, neither diabetes mellitus nor pre-diabetes mellitus independently predicted incident angina pectoris."
12530768,Mazza 2001,european journal of epidemiology,"Stroke occurs particularly frequently in elderly people and, being more often disabling than fatal, entails a high social burden. The predictors of stroke mortality have been identified in 3282 subjects aged > or = 65 years, taking part in the CArdiovascular STudy in the ELderly (CASTEL), a population-based study performed in Northeast Italy. Historical and clinical data, blood tests and 14 year fatal events were recorded. Continuous items were divided into quintiles and, for each quintile, adjusted relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals [CI] was derived from multivariate Cox analysis. Age, historical stroke (RR: 5.2; 95% CI: 3.18-8.6) and coronary artery disease (RR: 1.38; CI: 1.18-2.1), atrial fibrillation (RR: 2.40; CI: 1.42-4.0), arterial hypertension (RR: 1.33; CI: 1.15 1.76), systolic blood pressure > or = 163 mmHg (RR: 1.84; CI: 1.20-2.59), pulse pressure > or = 74 mmHg (RR: 1.50; CI: 1.13-2.40), cigarette smoking (RR: 1.60; CI: 1.03-2.47), electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (RR: 1.72; CI: 1.10-2.61), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, RR: 1.83; CI: 1.10-3.0), uric acid (UA) > 0.38 mmol/l (RR: 1.61; CI: 1.14-2.10), serum potassium > or = 5 mEq/l (RR: 1.70; CI: 1.24-2.50) and serum sodium < or = 139 mEql/l (RR: 1.34; 1.10-2.10) increased the risk of stroke. In the CASTEL, stroke was the first cardiovascular cause of death. Some independent predictors usually unrelated to stroke mortality (namely pulse pressure, pre-diabetic IGT, UA and blood electrolytes disorders) have been identified."
15677797,McNeill 2005,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of the association between the National Cholesterol Education Program's Third Adult Treatment Panel Report (ATP III) definition of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cox regression was used to estimate the relative risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke among 12,089 black and white middle-aged individuals in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. RESULTS: The metabolic syndrome was present in approximately 23% of individuals without diabetes or prevalent CVD at baseline. Over an average of 11 years of follow-up, 879 incident CHD and 216 ischemic stroke events occurred. Among the components of the metabolic syndrome, elevated blood pressure and low levels of HDL cholesterol exhibited the strongest associations with CHD. Men and women with the metabolic syndrome were approximately 1.5 and 2 times more likely to develop CHD than control subjects after adjustment for age, smoking, LDL cholesterol, and race/ARIC center (sex interaction P < 0.03). Similar associations were found between the metabolic syndrome and incident ischemic stroke. Comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the metabolic syndrome did not materially improve CHD risk prediction beyond the level achieved by the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals without diabetes or CVD, but with the metabolic syndrome, were at increased risk for long-term cardiovascular outcomes, although statistical models suggested that most of that risk was accounted for by the FRS. Nevertheless, identification of individuals with the metabolic syndrome may provide opportunities to intervene earlier in the development of shared disease pathways that predispose individuals to both CVD and diabetes."

MetS (2001) was defined first using the original criteria from the Third Adult Treatment Panel Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (> or =3 of the following: large waist circumference (women >88 cm, men >102 cm), elevated triglycerides (> or =1.70 mmol/L), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (men <1.04 mmol/L, women <1.30 mmol/L), elevated fasting glucose (6.1 6.9 mmol/L), and high blood pressure (> or =130/85 mmHg or self-reported use of medications for hypertension). Subjects were also classified according to the revised definition of the MetS (2005) that applies the lower threshold for fasting glucose (5.6-6.9 mmol/L). RESULTS: During follow-up (median 11 years), 818 coronary heart disease (CHD), 401 stroke, and 554 congestive heart failure (CHF) events occurred. Age- and race-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for CHD, stroke, and CHF were 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.57), 0.94 (95% CI = 0.73-1.21), and 1.40 (95% CI = 1.12-1.76) for women and 1.35 (95% CI = 1.10 1.66), 1.51 (95% CI = 1.08-2.12), and 1.47 (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) for men, respectively. Overall, women and men with MetS (2005) were 20% to 30% more likely to experience any CVD event than subjects without MetS (2005). Using the lower cut-point for IFG resulted in a near tripling in IFG prevalence (16% to 46%) and an additional 9% classified with MetS (2005) but HRs similar to those estimated from the original MetS (2001) criteria. High blood pressure was the component most strongly associated with incident CHD. CONCLUSION: Results from this study of an elderly, population-based cohort provide support for earlier investigations in primarily middle-aged populations that link the presence of MetS with the development of CVD and further underscore the importance of recognizing and treating its individual components, particularly high blood pressure."
28590145,Michishita 2017,clinical and experimental hypertension,"Aim: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be an etiologic cause of aging, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and metabolic syndrome. However, the influence of these cardiovascular risk factors and their combination on the development of CKD remains controversial. This retrospective study evaluated the influence of cardiovascular risk factors and their combination on the incidence of CKD during a 6-year follow-up period in middle-aged and older males. Methods: The subjects were 303 males without a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal dysfunction, or dialysis treatment. A biochemical analysis, blood pressure (BP) analysis, and anthropometry measurements were performed every year, and the classification of CKD was also assessed based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and/or presence of proteinuria. Results: After 6 years, the incidence of CKD was noted in 32 subjects. According to a multivariable analysis, hypertension (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.95, 95% confidence of interval [CI]: 1.64-9.49, p = 0.002) and hyperglycemia (HR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.42-7.56, p = 0.006) were significantly associated with the incidence of CKD. According to a Cox proportional hazards model, the HR for the incidence of CKD was significantly higher in the combination of high-normal BP/hypertension and impaired fasting glucose/DM group than in the combination of normotensive and normal glucose tolerance group (HR: 7.16, 95% CI: 2.43-17.25, p = 0.001). Conclusions: These results suggest that the hypertension and hyperglycemia and their combination may be associated with the incidence of CKD."
26463623,Mirbolouk 2016,geriatrics & gerontology international,"AIMS: To determine the effect of different glucose categories on incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in a population-based cohort. METHODS: A total of 834 individuals aged 65 years and older without a history of CVD at baseline were stratified according to 2-h post-load glucose fasting glucose test into six categories including: (i) normal fasting glucose/normal glucose tolerance; (ii) prediabetes, (iii) isolated fasting hyperglycemia (IFH); (iv) isolated post-challenge hyperglycemia (IPH); (v) IPH and IFH; and (vi) known diabetes mellitus. The prognostic significance of these groups on CVD and total mortality were examined by Cox proportional hazard ratios in a multivariate adjusted model. RESULTS: Over 9 years of follow up, 186 incidents of CVD and 218 deaths occurred (72 CVD mortality).Of the population, 45.2%, 30.7%, 1.2%, 6.1% 4.7%, and 11.9% were normal fasting glucose/normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes IFH, IPH, IFH and IPH, and known diabetes mellitus, respectively. Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for CVD were 1.13 (95% CI 0.78-1.64), 1.03 (95% CI 0.25-4.22), 1.17 (95% CI 0.65-2.11), 2.52 (95% CI 1.43-4.42) and 2.39 (95% CI 1.55-3.69), and for CVD mortality were 0.59 (95% CI 0.27-1.30), 2.02 (95% CI 0.27-15.15), 1.26 (95% CI 0.51-3.16), 3.57 (95% CI 1.64-7.75), and 4.70 (95% CI 2.54-8.69) for prediabetes, IFH, IPH, IFH and IPH, and known diabetes mellitus phenotypes, respectively. Corresponding hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in multivariate model adjusted for prevalent CVD were 1.07 (95% CI 0.73-1.57), 0.59 (95% CI 0.08-4.30), 0.92 (95% CI 0.5-1.70), 2.31 (95% CI 1.33-4.01) and 3.88 (95% CI 2.70-5.55), respectively. CONCLUSION: Among the elderly population with newly diagnosed diabetes, only the combined IFH and IPH phenotype, but not IFH or IPH alone, was a significant predictor of CVD and mortality events.

28403935,Mongraw-Chaffin 2017,metabolism,"BACKGROUND: While there is increasing recognition of the risks associated with hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes, few studies have investigated incident cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes with regard to low fasting glucose in the general population. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that low fasting glucose would be associated with cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women. METHODS: To test our hypothesis, we used both continuous incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards models in 17,287 participants from the Women's Health Initiative with fasting glucose measured at baseline. Participants were separated into groups based on fasting glucose level: low (<80mg/dL), normal/reference (80-99mg/dL), impaired (100-125mg/dL), and diabetic (>=126mg/dL). RESULTS: Participants were free of cardiovascular disease at enrollment, had mean age of 62years, and were 52% Caucasian, 24% African American, 8% Asian, and 12% Hispanic. Median follow-up was 15years. Graphs of continuous incidence rates compared to fasting glucose distribution exhibited evidence of a weak J-shaped association with heart failure and mortality that was predominantly due to participants with treated diabetes. Impaired and diabetic fasting glucose were positively associated with all outcomes. Associations for low fasting glucose differed, with coronary heart disease (HR=0.64 (0.42, 0.98)) significantly inverse; stroke (0.73 (0.48, 1.13)), combined cardiovascular disease (0.91 (0.73, 1.14)), and all-cause mortality (0.97 (0.79, 1.20)) null or inverse and not significant; and heart failure (1.27 (0.80, 2.02)) positive and not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Fasting glucose at the upper range, but not the lower range, was significantly associated with incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality."
14985967,Nakagami 2004,diabetologia,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The study was done to assess how well fasting and 2-h plasma glucose (FPG, 2-h PG) after a 75-g OGTT predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in Asian subjects. METHODS: People ( n=6817) of Japanese and Asian Indian origin from five prospective studies in five countries were monitored for 5 to 10 years. Hazard ratios for death from all causes and CVD were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for FPG, 2-h PG and established risk factors. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that an increase in FPG from 7.0 to 8.0 mmol/l (increase of 0.76 SD) increased relative risk (95% CI) by 1.14 (1.05-1.25) for all-cause and 1.24 (1.10-1.39) for CVD mortality. An increase in 2-h PG from 9.0 to 11.9 mmol/l (0.76 SD) increased relative risks by 1.29 (1.18-1.41) and 1.35 (1.19-1.54). Inclusion of 2-h PG in the FPG model improved the predictive value ( p<0.001), whereas FPG did not influence the predictive value of 2-h PG ( p>10). In a model containing FPG and 2 h PG, hazards ratios for 2-h PG in subjects with IGT or diabetes were 1.35 (1.03 1.77) or 3.03 (2.18-4.21) for all-cause and 1.27 (0.86-1.88) or 3.39 (2.14-5.37) for CVD mortality, compared with normal subjects. The respective hazards ratio for FPG in subjects with IFG or diabetes were 0.94 (0.68-1.31) or 0.88 (0.59 1.32) for all-cause and 1.05 (0.67-1.65) or 0.88 (0.51-1.51) for CVD mortality, compared with normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: For prediction of premature death, 2-h PG was superior to FPG in several Asian populations."
15036828,Nakanishi 2004,diabetes research and clinical practice,"To determine whether the clustered features of the metabolic syndrome precede the 7 year incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, we examined 6182 Japanese male office workers aged 35-59 years without any history of CVD. The 5588 subjects without type 2 diabetes also constituted the nondiabetic cohort, and were re-examined over seven successive years. Components of the metabolic syndrome included glycemic disorder (type 2 diabetes for the risk of CVD and impaired fasting glucose for the risk of type 2 diabetes), systemic obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. After controlling for age, family history of diabetes, alcohol intake, and cigarette smoking, the multivariate-adjusted relative risk of incidence of CVD compared with absence of components was 3.18, 3.48, 12.55, and 14.15 (P for trend <0.001), for the presence of 1,2,3, and > or =4 components, respectively. The corresponding relative risks of incidence of type 2 diabetes were 1.92, 4.36, 6.44, and 15.08 (P for trend <0.001). In both non-smokers and current smokers, the multivariate-adjusted relative risks of incidence of CVD and type 2 diabetes increased as the number of components increased (P for trend <0.001 for all). Our findings indicate that clustered features of the metabolic syndrome are closely associated with development of CVD and type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Japanese."
31943096,Neves 2020,journal of clinical endocrinology & metabolism,"Purpose: Despite our understanding of diabetes as an established risk factor for progressive kidney disease and cardiac complications, the prognostic significance of prediabetes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains largely unknown. Methods: Participants of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) were categorized as having normoglycemia, prediabetes, or diabetes according to fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and treatment with antidiabetic drugs at baseline. Unadjusted and adjusted proportional hazards models were fit to estimate the association of prediabetes and diabetes (versus normoglycemia) with: (1) composite renal outcome (end-stage renal disease, 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate to ≤ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or doubling of urine protein-to-creatinine ratio to ≥ 0.22 g/g creatinine); (2) composite cardiovascular (CV) outcome (congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke); and (3) all-cause mortality. Results: Of the 3701 individuals analyzed, 945 were normoglycemic, 847 had prediabetes and 1909 had diabetes. The median follow-up was 7.5 years. Prediabetes was not associated with the composite renal outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.32; P = 0.14), but was associated with proteinuria progression (aHR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03-1.47; P = 0.02). Prediabetes was associated with a higher risk of the composite CV outcome (aHR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05-1.82; P = 0.02) and a trend towards all-cause mortality (aHR 1.28; 95% CI, 0.99-1.66; P = 0.07). Participants with diabetes had an increased risk of the composite renal outcome, the composite CV outcome, and all-cause mortality. Conclusions: In individuals with CKD, prediabetes was not associated with composite renal outcome, but was associated with an increased risk of proteinuria progression and adverse CV outcomes."
18024949,Nielson 2007,angiology,"The objective of this study was to determine if elevations in blood glucose, in a range classified as impaired fasting glucose, are associated with a greater incidence of cerebrovascular disease in nondiabetic patients. Morning blood glucose determinations were evaluated with respect to subsequent stroke using records from 28 477 nondiabetic patients. Strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) were identified from ICD-9 coding for a new event more than a year after baseline glucose determinations. Of the patients studied, 593 suffered stroke or TIA over a total risk analysis time of 100 982 years. Higher baseline morning glucose (100 to 126 mg/dL vs under 100 mg/dL) was associated with 31% more diagnoses (2.4% vs 1.8%, P < .001). Incidence rate was 5.3 per 1000 patient-years for those patients with glucose over 100 mg/dL and 3.9 per 1000 patient-years for those with glucose under 100 mg/dL (P <.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated baseline glucose was associated with a progressive, increased risk with time. A Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for age, body mass index, sex, creatinine, lipids, smoking, and medications showed that elevated fasting glucose was associated with an increased hazard for a new event (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.46, glucose over 100 mg/dL vs under 100 mg/dL). Thus, patients with higher baseline blood glucose levels in the absence of diabetes and after adjustment for covariants have a significantly greater risk for development of cerebrovascular disease."
17876378,Nigam 2007,canadian journal of cardiology,"Background: Chronic hyperglycemia plays a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD); however, the cut-off level beyond which glycemia becomes detrimental is still controversial. Postprandial glycemia may be a stronger CAD risk factor than fasting glycemia in patients without documented heart disease. Objectives: To identify the contributions of fasting and postprandial glycemia to cardiovascular risk in patients with documented coronary artery disease. Methods: The Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry is a database of 24,958 patients with suspected or proven CAD who underwent cardiac catheterization between 1974 and 1979. Median long-term follow up was 14.7 years (interquartile range 9.8 to 16.2 years). Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to fasting glucose levels and 2 h postprandial (postmeal) plasma glucose (2hPG) levels. A total of 13,176 patients with baseline fasting glucose levels and 1691 patients with 2hPG levels were identified. Results: Impaired fasting glycemia was associated with a 1.2-fold increase in both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.40 for cardiovascular mortality), while undiagnosed diabetes was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for the same end points. Postprandial hyperglycemia (2hPG of 7.8 mmol/L to 11.0 mmol/L following an average meal) was not associated with a significant risk of death after adjustment for traditional risk factors or in the presence of fasting glucose of less than 6.1 mmol/L. Conclusions: In CAD patients, impaired fasting glucose is associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, whereas postprandial hyperglycemia following an average meal does not appear to be a risk factor."
17381496,Nilsson 2007,diabetic medicine,"AIMS: Between 1998 and 2005, a number of definitions of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) have been proposed. The aim of this population-based cohort study was to compare prevalence rates and the prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using different definitions of MetS. METHODS: A total of 5047 non-diabetic subjects (66% women), from the city of Malmo, Sweden, were followed. The incidence of fatal and non-fatal CVD (cardiac events, n = 176, and stroke, n = 171) was monitored over 11 years of follow-up. MetS was defined in three different ways [by International Diabetes Federation (IDF), National Cholesterol Education Program--Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII), or European Group for the study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR) criteria] based on data on waist circumference, blood pressure, serum triglycerides, High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting blood glucose. The IDF definition identified 21.9% of the subjects having the MetS. Corresponding figures for the NCEP-ATPIII and EGIR definitions were 20.7 and 18.8%, respectively. RESULTS: After taking age, gender, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lifestyle factors into account, the hazard ratio (HR) for CVD event according to the IDF, NCEP-ATPIII and EGIR definitions were HR 1.11 (95% CI: 0.86-1.44), 1.59 (1.25-2.03) and 1.35 (1.05-1.74), respectively. The results were largely similar for cardiac and stroke events. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Mets according to the IDF definition was higher in comparison with NCEP-ATPIII and EGIR definitions, but the IDF definition was not superior to these definitions for prediction of CVD events. This was true for both genders and questions the usefulness of the current IDF criteria of MetS in a North European, Caucasian population. In addition, single risk factors such as smoking had an equal prediction as the metabolic syndrome."
18249204,Oizumi 2008,metabolism,"Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which includes stroke as well as coronary heart disease (CHD). We investigated whether IGT is a risk factor for stroke. The incidence of stroke and CHD in a cohort population (n = 2938) consisting of participants of the 1990-1997 Funagata study was assessed through interviews with the participants and their family members and reviews of death certificates and residence transfer documents through 2002. Glucose tolerance at the baseline was classified according to the criteria of the 1998 World Health Organization (normal glucose tolerance, n = 2189; IGT, n = 320; and diabetes, n = 286). The cumulative incidences among the groups were compared using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, and the risks of these conditions were evaluated by person-year and Cox proportional hazard methods. During the 147-month (mean, 116.5 months) follow-up, 158 (normal glucose tolerance, IGT, and diabetes: 94, 35, and 29, respectively) participants experienced a stroke and 94 (54, 16, and 24, respectively) experienced CHD. By the person-year method, IGT and diabetes were shown to be significant risk factors for stroke and CHD (odds ratio, 1.87 [95% confidence interval, 1.73-2.03] and 3.57 [3.21-3.98] for stroke; 1.53 [1.31-1.78] and 3.47 [2.91-4.14] for CHD, respectively). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that IGT was a risk factor for stroke (age-, sex-, and hypertension-adjusted hazard ratio: 1.51 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.24], P = .039) but not for CHD (1.21 [0.69-2.313], .509). Impaired glucose tolerance is a risk factor for future stroke in a Japanese population."
15931618,Onat 2005,metabolism,"AIM: The objective of this study was to investigate sex-specific differences existing on the way from (abdominal) obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: A population sample of 1974 men and women, representative of Turkish adults (mean age, 48 years), with normal glucose metabolism (GM) and free of CVD at baseline, was prospectively evaluated at a mean 4.1 years of follow-up. The term abnormal GM designated both DM and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Metabolic syndrome was identified in 29% of men and 40% of women by the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Fatal and nonfatal CVD, diagnosed by clinical findings and Minnesota coding of resting electrocardiograms, developed in 121 subjects. RESULTS: The cohort was dichotomized by the presence or absence of MS and of obesity defined by a body mass index of 30 kg/m 2 or greater. Compared with the major female group with no obesity or MS, women with MS, regardless of the presence of obesity, predicted highly significantly the development of abnormal GM with relative risks exceeding 2, whereas no independent significant association was noted in men with MS. Similar divergence of sexes pertained to the prediction of diabetes. When age, smoking status, grade of physical activity, IFG, DM, and the 4 groups with obesity and MS were analyzed for the prediction of CVD by logistic regression, men with MS, regardless of the presence of obesity, predicted highly significantly CVD (with relative risks ranging from 2 to 4), but neither DM nor IFG contributed independently. Conversely, in women, abnormal GM predicted CVD independent of age, smoking status, and grade of physical activity, but the groups with obesity and MS failed to significantly contribute independently. CONCLUSIONS: In populations with prevalent MS, whereas women with normal GM are prone to DM within the context of MS and are exposed to CVD risk primarily by way of DM, men are prone to visceral adiposity, less susceptible to DM, and run CVD risk primarily by the intermediary of MS, largely independent of the DM component."
21769500,Onat 2013,acta diabetologica,"We determined in non-diabetic persons the risk of fasting and non-fasting glucose levels for pre-diabetes, diabetes, and coronary heart disease (CHD), including the roles of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and HDL cholesterol, and delineated risk profiles of the pre-diabetic states. Over 71/4 years, 2,619 middle-aged Turkish adults free of diabetes and CHD were studied prospectively. Using different serum glucose categories including impaired fasting glucose (IFG, 6.1 6.97 mmol/L) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), outcomes were analyzed by Cox regression. IFG was identified at baseline in 112 and IGT in 33 participants. Metabolic syndrome components distinguished individuals with IFG from those with normoglycemia. Participants with IGT tended to differ from adults in normal postprandial glucose categories in regard to high levels of triglycerides, apoA I, and CRP. Diabetes risk, adjusted for sex, age, waist circumference, CRP, and HDL cholesterol, commenced at a fasting 5.6-6.1 mmol/L threshold, was fourfold at levels 6.1-6.97 mmol/L. Optimal glucose values regarding CHD risk were 5.0-6.1 mmol/L. Fasting and postprandial glucose values were not related to CHD risk in men; IGT alone predicted risk in women (HR 3.74 [1.16;12.0]), independent of age, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, waist circumference, smoking status, and CRP. HDL cholesterol was unrelated to the development of IFG, IGT, and diabetes, while CRP elevation independently predicted the development of diabetes. IGT independently predicts CHD risk, especially in women. HDL dysfunction associated with low-grade inflammation is a co-determinant of pre diabetic states and their progression to diabetes."
16874146,Palmieri 2006,european society of cardiology,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factor research has recently broadened its focus based on new data indicating the benefits of low risk, i.e. favorable levels of all major risk factors. The aims of this study were to assess further the relation of low risk to coronary heart disease risk, and implications for prevention. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective population-based Italian study, of 7438 men and 13 009 women aged 35-69 years, with a mean follow-up of 10.4 years and validated first coronary events. METHODS: Baseline coronary heart disease risk was classified into three categories: low risk; unfavorable but not high risk; and high risk. To analyze the relation of these risk profiles to coronary heart disease incidence, age-adjusted, sex-averaged coronary heart disease incidence was calculated for persons free of coronary heart disease and stroke, stratified as baseline low risk, unfavorable but not high risk or high risk. To assess the independent relationship of individual risk factors to coronary heart disease incidence, multivariate proportional hazards models were computed for combinations of risk factors. RESULTS: Only 2.7% of participants met low risk criteria; 81.4% were high risk. Age-adjusted coronary heart disease incidence for the whole cohort was 37.1 out of 10000 person-years (men 59.0; women 15.3). No coronary heart disease events occurred in low-risk men, only two in low-risk women. For women and men who were not high risk, the age-sex standardized coronary heart disease rate was 62% lower than for high-risk participants. Blood pressure, need for antihypertensive medication, smoking, hyperglycemia, diabetes, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independently related to coronary heart disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable levels of all modifiable readily measured risk factors - rare among Italian adults - assure minimal coronary heart disease risk. Population-wide prevention is needed, especially improved lifestyles, to increase the proportion of the population at low risk."
17259502,Pankow 2007,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: We compared and contrasted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, subclinical manifestations of CVD, incident coronary heart disease (CHD), and all cause mortality by categories of impaired glucose regulation in nondiabetic individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 6,888 participants aged 52-75 years who had no history of diabetes or CVD. All-cause mortality and incident CHD were ascertained over a median of 6.3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Agreement between fasting and postchallenge glucose impairment was poor: 3,048 subjects (44%) had neither impaired fasting glucose (IFG) nor impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 1,690 (25%) had isolated IFG, 1,000 (14%) had isolated IGT, and 1,149 (17%) had both IFG and IGT. After adjustment for age, sex, race, and center, subjects with isolated IFG were more likely to smoke, consume alcohol, and had higher mean BMI, waist circumference, LDL cholesterol, and fasting insulin and lower HDL cholesterol than those with isolated IGT, while subjects with isolated IGT had higher mean triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and white cell counts. Measures of subclinical CVD and rates of all-cause mortality and incident CHD were similar in isolated IFG and isolated IGT. CONCLUSIONS: Neither isolated IFG nor isolated IGT was associated with a more adverse CVD risk profile."
25414153,Paprott 2015,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association of HbA1c-defined glycemic status and continuous HbA1c with all-cause mortality. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population comprised 6,299 participants (aged 18-79 years) of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998, who were followed up for mortality for an average of 11.6 years. Glycemic status was defined as known diabetes (self-reported diagnosis or intake of antidiabetic medication) and based on HbA1c levels according to American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria as undiagnosed diabetes (>=6.5% [>=48 mmol/mol]), prediabetes with very high (6.0 6.4% [42-46 mmol/mol]) or high diabetes risk (5.7-5.9% [39-41 mmol/mol]), and normoglycemia (<5.7% [<39 mmol/mol]). Associations between glycemic status and mortality were examined by Cox regression adjusting for age, sex, education, lifestyle factors, anthropometric measures, and history of chronic diseases (reference: normoglycemia). Spline models were fitted to investigate associations between continuous HbA1c and mortality among participants without known diabetes. RESULTS: Excess mortality risk was observed for participants with known diabetes (hazard ratio 1.41 [95% CI 1.08-1.84]) and undiagnosed diabetes (1.63 [1.23 2.17]) but not for those with high (1.02 [0.80-1.30]) or very high diabetes risk (0.87 [0.67-1.13]). Spline models revealed a U-shaped association, with lowest risk at HbA1c levels 5.4-5.6% (36-38 mmol/mol) and a significantly increased risk at <=5.0% (<=31 mmol/mol) and >=6.4% (>=46 mmol/mol). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike known and undiagnosed diabetes, HbA1c levels in the prediabetic range were not associated with an increased mortality risk. The observed U-shaped relationship adds to existing evidence that not only high but also low HbA1c levels might be associated with all-cause mortality."

Methods: Among 8498 Iranian adults from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, aged ≥30 years and without diagnosed type 2 diabetes, gender-interactions were assessed for each outcome, followed by sex-separated multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of different prediabetes categories, including impaired fasting glucose (IFG), defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organization (WHO), as fasting plasma glucose of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and 6.1-6.9 mmol/L, respectively, and impaired glucose tolerance, defined as 2-h post challenge plasma glucose of 7.8-11 mmol/L. Results: Sex-specific associations existed for men between IFG-ADA and chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI 0.99-1.65; p interaction = 0.008) and between IFG-WHO and stroke (hazard ratio: 2.15, 95% CI 1.08-4.27; p interaction = 0.21); and for women between IFG-ADA and hypertension (hazard ratio: 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; p interaction = 0.06) and between impaired glucose tolerance and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio: 1.57, 95% CI 1.14-2.16; p interaction = 0.05). Among both genders, all prediabetes definitions were associated with type 2 diabetes but none with mortality. Conclusions: The hazards of prediabetes definitions may differ between genders depending on the outcome of interest. IFG-WHO among men and impaired glucose tolerance among women are particularly important because of their association with incident stroke and coronary heart disease, respectively. Considering these sex differences could improve personalized management of prediabetes."

Research design and methods: We included 10,373 participants without (8,096 white, 2,277 black) and 727 with diagnosed diabetes (425 white, 302 black) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare hazards ratios of CVD and ESRD among blacks and whites from baseline (1990-1992) through 2012. We compared the odds ratios (from logistic regression) of retinopathy among blacks and whites. We tested for the interaction of each biomarker with race. Results: Median values of biomarkers were higher among blacks versus whites (all P < 0.001). Relative risks for each biomarker with incident CVD and ESRD, and odds ratios for each biomarker with prevalent retinopathy, were similar by race (all P values for interaction by race >0.10). Conclusions: The prognostic value of HbA1c, fructosamine, glycated albumin, and 1,5-AG with incident CVD, incident ESRD, and prevalent retinopathy were similar by race. Our results support similar interpretation of HbA1c and nontraditional biomarkers of hyperglycemia among black and whites with respect to long-term complications."
30335505,Pavlovic 2019,european journal of preventive cardiology,"Background: We assessed the prevalence of newly diagnosed prediabetes and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and their impact on long-term mortality in patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Methods: We included patients hospitalized with HFrEF and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III. Baseline two-hour oral glucose tolerance test was used to classify patients as normoglycaemic or having newly diagnosed prediabetes or T2DM. Outcomes included post-discharge all-cause and cardiovascular mortality during the median follow-up of 2.1 years. Results: At baseline, out of 150 patients (mean-age 57 ± 12 years; 88% male), prediabetes was diagnosed in 65 (43%) patients, and T2DM in 29 (19%) patients. These patients were older and more often with NYHA class III symptoms, but distribution of comorbidities was similar to normoglycaemic patients. Taking normoglycaemic patients as a reference, adjusted risk of all-cause mortality was significantly increased both in patients with prediabetes (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-6.3; p = 0.040) and in patients with T2DM (hazard ratio, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.7-15.3; p = 0.023). Likewise, both prediabetes (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.9; p = 0.041) and T2DM (hazard ratio, 9.7; 95% CI 2.9-36.7; p = 0.018) independently increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with normoglycaemic individuals. There was no interaction between either prediabetes or T2DM and heart failure aetiology or gender on study outcomes (all interaction p-values > 0.05). Conclusions: Newly diagnosed prediabetes and T2DM are highly prevalent in patients hospitalized for worsening HFrEF and NYHA functional class II-III. Importantly, they impose independently increased long-term risk of higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality."
25624343,Qiu 2015,hypertension,"Whether prediabetes mellitus alone or combined with other disorders means a higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still controversial. This study aimed to investigate the association between prediabetes mellitus and CVD and diabetes mellitus and to explore whether prediabetes mellitus alone or combined with other syndromes, such as hypertension, could promote CVD risks significantly. This longitudinal population-based study of 1609 residents from Shanghai in Southern China was conducted between 2002 and 2014. Participants with a history of CVD at baseline were excluded from analysis. Multivariate log binomial regression models were used to adjust possible coexisting factors. Incidence of CVD during follow-up was 10.1%. After adjusting for age, sex, and other factors, the association between prediabetes mellitus and CVD was not observed. When hypertension was incorporated in stratifying factors, adjusted CVD risk was elevated significantly (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 4.64) in prediabetes mellitus and hypertension combined group, and coexistence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension made CVD risk highly significantly increased, reaching 3.43-fold higher than the reference group. Blood glucose level within prediabetic range is significantly associated with elevated risks for diabetes mellitus after multivariable adjustment, but only when it is concurrent with other disorders, such as hypertension, it will significantly increase CVD risk."
25770690,Rebnord 2015,atherosclerosis,"Objective: Associations of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels to incident coronary and cardiovascular events among non-diabetic patients with coronary artery disease are unclear. We investigated relations of HbA1c to long-term prognosis in such patients. Methods: A prospective cohort of 2519 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography for suspected stable angina pectoris (SAP) was divided into pre-defined categories according to HbA1c (%) levels (<5.0, 5.0-5.6 (reference), 5.7-6.4), and followed for median 4.9 years. The primary end-point was major coronary events (including non-fatal and fatal acute myocardial infarctions, and sudden cardiac death). Secondary end-points were death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were obtained by Cox regression. Results: Median age at inclusion was 62 years, 73% were males, median HbA1c was 5.6% and random plasma-glucose 5.4 mmol/L. After multivariate adjustment, HbA1c levels within the pre-diabetic range were not associated with risk of major coronary events, HR (95% CI): 1.13 (0.79-1.62); P=0.49, death from CVD or all-cause mortality HR (95% CI): 0.95 (0.55-1.66) and 1.04 (0.70-1.53), respectively; P≥0.85. Similarly, there was no significant association between HbA1c values within the lowest category and risk of study outcomes, (P≥0.18). Conclusion: In non-diabetic patients with suspected SAP, there was no overall association between HbA1c levels and prognosis, questioning an independent role of glycemia in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic complications in these patients."
26773930,Rhee 2016,metabolism,"OBJECTIVE: Diabetes and prediabetes subjects have increased risk for mortality. We analyzed the mortality risk due to all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer in Korean subjects participating in a health-screening program according to baseline glycemic status and HbA1c levels. MATERIALS/METHODS: Among 241,499 participants of a health-screening program between 2005 and 2012, the risk of death from all causes, CVD, and cancer was calculated based on the baseline glycemic status (normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes) and HbA1c levels. Uncontrolled diabetes was defined as HbA1c>=7.0%. Vital status and confirmation of the cause of death were based on the analysis of death certificate records from the National Death Index. RESULTS: During 923,343.1 person-years of follow-up, 877 participants died. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of subjects with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes to normoglycemic subjects for all-cause mortality were 1.58 (95% CI 1.24-2.03) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.78-2.86), respectively. The HRs of subjects with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes to normoglycemic subjects for mortality due to cancer were 1.75 (95% CI 1.23-2.48) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.13-2.45). However, glycemic status was not significantly associated with the risk of mortality due to CVD. The subjects with HbA1c higher than 6.5% showed more than 2-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality and the subjects with HbA1c lower than 5.2% showed increased HR (1.45, 95% CI 1.06-1.97) compared with those with HbA1c of 5.5% in subjects not taking anti-diabetic medications. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risk from all causes and cancer significantly increased in diabetes subjects regardless of the glucose control status. In subjects not taking anti-diabetic medications, both high and low HbA1c resulted in increased risk for all-cause mortality."
32272722,Rhee 2020,journal of clinical medicine,"Background: High blood glucose level has a linear relationship with all-cause mortality. However, the influence of glycemic abnormality on mortality differs by age group. We aimed to analyze all-cause mortality according to glycemic status, age groups, and comorbidities using a national health database. Methods: The 6,330,369 participants who underwent Korean National Health Screening in 2009 were followed up until 2016, with a median follow-up of 7.3 years. All-cause mortality rates were analyzed according to glycemic status (normoglycemia, impaired fasting glucose [IFG], newly diagnosed diabetes, diabetes duration <5 years, diabetes duration ≥5 years), age groups (20-39, 40-65, and ≥65 years), and comorbidities using the Korean National Health Insurance System database. Results: At baseline, 712,901 (11.3%) subjects had diabetes. Compared with subjects without diabetes, those with diabetes at baseline showed increased mortality risk after adjustment for multiple risk factors (hazard ratio [HR] 1.613; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.598,1.629), and those with IFG showed a significantly increased mortality risk compared with normoglycemic subjects (HR 1.053; 95% CI 1.042,1.064). Mortality risk associated with glycemic status decreased gradually from younger to older age groups and was consistently higher in those with diabetes with coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke or decreased renal function than those without comorbidities. Conclusion: Compared with normoglycemic subjects, subjects with diabetes and IFG had an increased mortality risk and the mortality risk was higher in the younger age group than in the older age group. The presence of diabetes and comorbid diseases synergistically increased mortality risk."
17259503,Rijkelijkhuizen 2007,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: To optimize identification of future diabetic patients, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) introduced criteria for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in 1997 (IFG 6.1 mmol/l [IFG6.1]) and lowered the threshold from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l (IFG5.6) in 2003. Our aim was to assess the consequences of lowering the IFG cutoff on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and to evaluate whether this risk is explained by a conversion to type 2 diabetes within 6.4 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a population-based cohort, the Hoorn Study, plasma glucose was determined in 1989 and 1996 (n = 1,428). Subjects were classified in 1989 according to 1997 and 2003 ADA criteria. Subjects with IFG in 1989 were further classified according to diabetes status in 1996. Hazard ratios for CVD mortality (n = 81) in the period 1996-2005 were adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Subjects with IFG6.1, but not IFG5.6, had a significantly higher CVD mortality risk than normal fasting glucose (NFG) subjects. Subjects who converted from IFG to diabetes (IFG6.1: 42%; IFG5.6: 21%) had a more than twofold risk of CVD mortality (IFG6.1: 2.47 [1.17-5.19]; IFG5.6: 2.14 [1.12-4.10]) than subjects with NFG. IFG subjects who did not develop diabetes did not have significantly higher CVD mortality risks (IFG6.1: 1.50 [0.72-3.15]; IFG5.6: 1.15 [0.69-1.93]). CONCLUSIONS: The lower cutoff for IFG (ADA 2003 criteria) results in a category of IFG that no longer represents a high-risk state of CVD. Furthermore, only subjects who convert from IFG to diabetes have a high risk of CVD mortality."
30273572,Robich 2019,annals of thoracic surgery,"Background: A patient's hemoglobin (Hb) A1c level, regardless of diabetic status, is a measure of glycemic control. Studies have found it is an independent predictor of short-term death in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In this study, we used preoperative HbA1c to assess whether levels are associated with short-term and long-term survival after CABG. Methods: From a regional registry of consecutive cases, we identified 6,415 patients undergoing on-pump isolated CABG from 2008 to 2015 with documented preoperative HbA1c level. We defined four HbA1c groups: less than 5.7% (n = 1,713), 5.7% to 6.4% (n = 2,505), 6.5% to 8.0% (n = 1,377), and more than 8% (n = 820). Relationship to in-hospital outcomes and long-term survival was assessed. Outcome rates and hazard ratios were adjusted for patient and disease risk factors using multivariable logistic regression and Cox models. Results: The study included 3,740 patients (58%) not diagnosed as having diabetes and 2,674 with diabetes. Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%) was documented in 52% (n = 1,933) of nondiabetic patients. Higher HbA1c values were associated with younger age, female sex, greater body mass index, more comorbid diseases, lower ejection fraction, more 3-vessel coronary disease, and recent myocardial infarction (p < 0.05 trend for all). After adjustment for patient risk, greater HbA1c values were not associated with higher rates of in-hospital death or morbidity. Long-term survival was significantly worse as HbA1c increased. Risk of death increased by 13% for every unit increase in HbA1c (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.19; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Preadmission glycemic control, as assessed by HbA1c, is predictive of long-term survival, with higher levels associated with poorer prognosis. Whether this risk can be modified by better glycemic control postoperatively remains to be determined."
12032097,Rodriguez 2002,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications in a sample of elderly Japanese-American men; to examine the association with total and cardiovascular mortality by diabetes status using both classifications; and to determine whether the fasting or 2-h glucose measurement is a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Examinations given from 1991 to 1993 in the Honolulu Heart Program were used as baseline for these analyses. Subjects were 71-93 years of age at that time and were followed for total and cardiovascular disease mortality for up to 7 years. RESULTS: A total of approximately 66% of individuals who had diabetes by WHO criteria were missed when the ADA definition was used. The relative risks of total and cardiovascular mortality for those with versus those without diabetes were similar for both definitions; however, when fasting and postload glucose measures were analyzed as continuous variables, the 2-h measurement was a superior predictor and was independent of fasting glucose. In contrast, fasting glucose was not an independent predictor of these outcomes in the presence of the 2-h measurement. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of glucose metabolism abnormalities was very high among elderly Japanese-American men. The WHO classification was superior to the ADA classification in identification of subjects at high risk for adverse outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that the 2-h glucose measurement is valuable and should be retained in epidemiologic studies."
24466339,Rutten-Jacobs 2014,plos one,"Background: Diabetes diagnosed prior to stroke in young adults is strongly associated with recurrent vascular events. The relevance of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and incidence of diabetes after young stroke is unknown. We investigated the long-term incidence of diabetes after young stroke and evaluated the association of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose with recurrent vascular events. Methods: This study was part of the FUTURE study. All consecutive patients between January 1, 1980, and November 1, 2010 with TIA or ischemic stroke, aged 18-50, were recruited. A follow-up assessment was performed in survivors between November 1, 2009 and January 1, 2012 and included an evaluation for diabetes, fasting venous plasma glucose and recurrent vascular events. The association of diabetes and IFG with recurrent vascular events was assessed by logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex and follow-up duration. Results: 427 survivors without a medical history of diabetes were included in the present analysis (mean follow-up of 10.1 (SD 8.4) years; age 40.3 (SD 7.9) years). The incidence rate of diabetes was 7.9 per 1000 person-years and the prevalence of IFG was 21.1%. Patients with diabetes and IFG were more likely to have experienced any vascular event than those with normal fasting glucose values (OR 3.5 (95%CI 1.5-8.4) for diabetes and OR 2.5 (95%CI 1.3-4.8) for IFG). Conclusions: Diabetes or IFG in young stroke survivors is frequent and is associated with recurrent vascular events. Regular screening for IFG and diabetes in this population, yields potential for secondary prevention."
21300356,Saito 2011,atherosclerosis,"OBJECTIVE: Although diabetes has a great impact on coronary heart disease (CHD) in Western populations, there is limited evidence that diabetes influences CHD in the Japanese population. METHODS: The Japan Public Health Center-based prospective (JPHC) study conducted a follow-up of 31,192 individuals aged 40-69 years with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer. Subjects were classified at baseline as normal, borderline diabetic or diabetic based on fasting and non-fasting blood glucose levels and the use of medication to treat diabetes. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between diabetes and the risk of fatal and non-fatal CHD events after adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: During 12.9 years of follow-up (1990-2006), we identified 266 fatal and non-fatal coronary events using validated criteria. With normal individuals serving as a control, the hazard ratios for total incident CHD events after adjusting for sex, age, study community and fasting were 1.65 (95% CI, 1.19-2.29) and 3.05 (2.03-4.59) in the borderline and diabetic groups, respectively. These associations remained significant after adjustment for conventional risk factors. The population attributable fractions (PAF) of borderline diabetes and diabetes for CHD events were 6.9% and 6.3%, respectively. Furthermore, there was a trend for an association between an impaired fasting glucose (5.6-6.9 mmol/l) and an increased risk of CHD events. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study suggests that diabetes and elevated glucose levels are associated with incident CHD in the general Japanese population. The PAF of diabetes for fatal and non-fatal coronary events was estimated to be moderate."
26802220,Salazara 2016,diabetes and vascular disease research,"The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that cardiovascular disease occurs to the greatest extent in persons with prediabetes mellitus who are also insulin resistant. In 2003, 664 non-diabetic women (n = 457) and men (n = 207), aged 52 ± 16 and 53 ± 15 years, were surveyed during a programme for cardiovascular disease prevention. Fasting plasma glucose concentrations defined participants as having normal fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose <5.6 mmol/L) or prediabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose ⩾ 5.6 and <7.0 mmol/L). The tertile of prediabetes mellitus subjects with the highest fasting plasma insulin concentration was classified as insulin resistant. Baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors were accentuated in prediabetes mellitus versus normal fasting glucose, particularly in prediabetes mellitus/insulin resistant. In 2012, 86% of the sample were surveyed again, and the crude incidence for cardiovascular disease was higher in subjects with prediabetes mellitus versus normal fasting glucose (13.7 vs 6.0/100 persons/10 years; age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio = 1.88, p = 0.052). In prediabetes mellitus, the crude incidences were 22.9 versus 9.6/100 persons/10 years in insulin resistant versus non-insulin resistant persons (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio = 2.36, p = 0.040). In conclusion, cardiovascular disease risk was accentuated in prediabetes mellitus/insulin resistant individuals, with a relative risk approximately twice as high compared to prediabetes mellitus/non-insulin resistant subjects."
26147402,Samaras 2015,journal of the american geriatrics society,"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) represents an intermediary condition between normal fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus and, specifically, whether elderly adults with IFG have higher disease burden, cardiovascular risk, and systemic inflammation and higher 2-year mortality and incident disease. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Population derived cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with a mean age of 78.6 +/- 4.7 (N = 945). MEASUREMENTS: Disease was ascertained using a standardized questionnaire at baseline and 2 years. Fasting metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative metabolism markers were measured. Disease prevalence, cardiovascular risk, and biochemical markers were compared to determine disease burden and metabolic disturbances in IFG. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for 2-year all-cause mortality and incident disease were determined. RESULTS: IFG prevalence was 41%. Individuals with IFG had higher baseline rates of heart disease than those with normal fasting glucose (NFG), similar to that in individuals with diabetes mellitus. IFG was characterized by higher inflammatory markers and oxidative metabolism end products and was an intermediary between NFG and diabetes mellitus for triglycerides and malondialdehyde. Discriminant analysis showed that IFG was independently associated with stroke and higher triglycerides and oxidative stress. Two-year all-cause mortality was 3.9%. The 2-year adjusted ORs for all cause mortality, incident cardiac disease, stroke, and cancer were similar between IFG and NFG, using both American Diabetes Association and World Health Organization IFG criteria. IFG did not predict secondary cardiac events, stroke, or cancer. CONCLUSION: IFG was an intermediary condition for heart disease, inflammation, and oxidative stress in elderly adults but not for 2-year incident disease or all-cause mortality. Longer-term prospective studies are needed to clarify whether IFG in elderly adults portends greater morbidity and mortality."
11473076,Saydah 2001,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: Although postchallenge hyperglycemia is a well-established feature of type 2 diabetes, its association with risk of mortality is uncertain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the independent association of fasting and 2 h glucose levels with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) Mortality Study, a prospective cohort study of U.S. adults examined in the NHANES II, and focused on the 3,092 adults aged 30-74 years who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test at baseline (1976 1980). Deaths were identified from U.S. national mortality files from 1976 to 1992. To account for the complex survey design, we used SUDAAN statistical software for weighted analysis. RESULTS: Compared with their normoglycemic counterparts (fasting glucose [FG] < 7.0 and 2-h glucose < 7.8 mmol/l), adults with fasting and postchallenge hyperglycemia (FG > or =7.0 and 2-h glucose > or =11.1 mmol/l) had a twofold higher risk of death after 16 years of follow-up (age and sex-adjusted relative hazard [RH] 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2). However, adults with isolated postchallenge hyperglycemia (FG < 7.0 and 2-h glucose > or =11.1 mmol/l) were also at higher risk of death (1.6, 1.0-2.6). In proportional hazards analysis, FG (fully adjusted RH 1.10 per 1 SD; 95% CI 1.01, 1.22) and 2-h glucose (1.14, 1.00-1.29) showed nearly identical predictive value for mortality. Similar trends were observed for CVD mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that postchallenge hyperglycemia is associated with increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality independently of other CVD risk factors."
22986731,Schottker 2013,diabetologia,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to assess the cardiovascular risk of individuals with fasting plasma glucose (FPG)- and/or HbA(1c)-defined prediabetes (5.6-6.9 mmol/l and 39-47 mmol/mol [5.7-6.4%], respectively) or manifest diabetes mellitus and to evaluate whether FPG or HbA(1c) can improve risk prediction beyond that estimated by the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) chart in individuals without diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Cox regression was employed to estimate HRs for primary incident cardiovascular events (CVEs) in a cohort of 8,365 individuals aged 50-74 years. Furthermore, HbA(1c) and FPG were added individually to the variables of the SCORE and measures of model discrimination and reclassification were assessed. RESULTS: During 8 years of follow-up, 702 individuals had a primary CVE. After adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors, HRs were attenuated close to one for the prediabetes groups (especially for women), whereas a 1.7- and a 1.9-fold increased risk persisted for men and women with diabetes, respectively. Extension of the SCORE variables by either FPG or HbA(1c) did not improve its predictive abilities in individuals without diabetes. There was a non-significant net reclassification improvement for men when HbA(1c) was added (2.2%, p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The increased cardiovascular risk of individuals with FPG- or HbA(1c)-defined prediabetes can mainly be explained by other cardiovascular risk factors. Adding FPG or HbA(1c) did not significantly improve CVE risk prediction by the SCORE variables in individuals without diabetes mellitus."
20200384,Selvin 2010,new england journal of medicine,"BACKGROUND: Fasting glucose is the standard measure used to diagnose diabetes in the United States. Recently, glycated hemoglobin was also recommended for this purpose. METHODS: We compared the prognostic value of glycated hemoglobin and fasting glucose for identifying adults at risk for diabetes or cardiovascular disease. We measured glycated hemoglobin in whole-blood samples from 11,092 black or white adults who did not have a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease and who attended the second visit (occurring in the 1990-1992 period) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. RESULTS: The glycated hemoglobin value at baseline was associated with newly diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes. For glycated hemoglobin values of less than 5.0%, 5.0 to less than 5.5%, 5.5 to less than 6.0%, 6.0 to less than 6.5%, and 6.5% or greater, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for diagnosed diabetes were 0.52 (0.40 to 0.69), 1.00 (reference), 1.86 (1.67 to 2.08), 4.48 (3.92 to 5.13), and 16.47 (14.22 to 19.08), respectively. For coronary heart disease, the hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.74 to 1.24), 1.00 (reference), 1.23 (1.07 to 1.41), 1.78 (1.48 to 2.15), and 1.95 (1.53 to 2.48), respectively. The hazard ratios for stroke were similar. In contrast, glycated hemoglobin and death from any cause were found to have a J-shaped association curve. All these associations remained significant after adjustment for the baseline fasting glucose level. The association between the fasting glucose levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease or death from any cause was not significant in models with adjustment for all covariates as well as glycated hemoglobin. For coronary heart disease, measures of risk discrimination showed significant improvement when glycated hemoglobin was added to models including fasting glucose. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based population of nondiabetic adults, glycated hemoglobin was similarly associated with a risk of diabetes and more strongly associated with risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause as compared with fasting glucose. These data add to the evidence supporting the use of glycated hemoglobin as a diagnostic test for diabetes."

We examined the association between 2010 American Diabetes Association diagnostic cut points for glycated hemoglobin and microvascular outcomes (chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease [ESRD], and retinopathy) and formally tested for the presence of risk thresholds in the relationships of glycated hemoglobin with these outcomes. Research design and methods: Prospective cohort and cross-sectional analyses of 11,357 participants (773 with a history of diagnosed diabetes) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Results: During a median of 14 years of follow-up of individuals without diagnosed diabetes at baseline, clinical categories of glycated hemoglobin were associated with risk of chronic kidney disease, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.12 (0.94-1.34) and 1.39 (1.04-1.85) for glycated hemoglobin 5.7-6.4% and ≥6.5%, respectively, as compared with <5.7% (P trend = 0.002). The corresponding HRs for ESRD were 1.51 (0.82-2.76) and 1.98 (0.83-4.73), respectively (P trend = 0.047). In the absence of diagnosed diabetes, glycated hemoglobin was cross sectionally associated with the presence of moderate/severe retinopathy, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.42 (0.69-2.92) and 2.91 (1.19-7.11) for glycated hemoglobin 5.7-<6.5% and ≥6.5%, respectively, compared with <5.7% (P trend = 0.011). Risk associations were stronger among individuals with a history of diabetes. We did not observe significant thresholds in the associations of glycated hemoglobin with kidney disease risk or retinopathy. Conclusions: These data from a community-based, biracial population support the use of new 2010 American Diabetes Association glycated hemoglobin cut points for the diagnosis of diabetes."
23723353,Selvin 2013,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: There is debate regarding the clinical significance of well established racial differences in HbA1c. We compared the associations of diabetes diagnostic categories for HbA1c and fasting glucose with clinical outcomes in black and white persons in the community. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of participants without diabetes or cardiovascular disease from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. We examined the associations of clinical categories of HbA1c (<5.7%, 5.7-6.4%, >=6.5%) and fasting glucose (<100, 100-125, >=126 mg/dL) with outcomes separately among 2,484 black and 8,593 white participants and tested for race interactions. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics differed significantly in blacks compared with whites, including HbA1c (5.8 vs. 5.4%; P<0.001). During 18 years of follow-up, there were trends of increased risk of kidney disease, fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, and stroke across categories of HbA1c in both blacks and whites. The adjusted hazard ratios for each outcome across categories of HbA1c were similar in blacks and whites (P for interaction>0.05) except for all-cause mortality. Patterns of association were similar, but weaker, for fasting glucose. HbA1c and fasting glucose both were more strongly associated with all-cause mortality in whites compared with blacks, largely explained by racial differences in the rate of cardiovascular deaths. CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c is a risk factor for vascular outcomes and mortality in both black and white adults. Patterns of association for HbA1c were similar to or stronger than those for fasting glucose. With respect to long-term outcomes, our findings support a similar interpretation of HbA1c in blacks and whites for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus."
25149362,Selvin 2014,circulation,"BACKGROUND: Persons with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus are at high risk for cardiovascular events. However, the relationships of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus to the development of subclinical myocardial damage are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured cardiac troponin T with a highly sensitive assay (hs cTnT) at 2 time points, 6 years apart, among 9051 participants of the community based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study with no diabetes mellitus, or prediabetes, and without cardiovascular disease including silent myocardial infarction by ECG. First, we examined the incidence of elevated hs-cTnT (>=14 ng/L) at 6 years of follow-up. Second, we examined clinical outcomes during the subsequent ~14 years of follow-up among persons with and without incident elevations in hs-cTnT. Cumulative probabilities of elevated hs-cTnT at 6 years among persons with no diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, and diabetes mellitus were 3.7%, 6.4%, and 10.8%, respectively. Compared with normoglycemic persons, the adjusted relative risks for incident elevated hs-cTnT were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.08 1.80) for prediabetes and 2.47 (95% CI, 1.78-3.43) for diabetes mellitus. Persons with diabetes mellitus and incident elevations in hs-cTnT were at a substantially higher risk of heart failure (hazard ratio, 6.37 [95% CI, 4.27-9.51]), death (hazard ratio, 4.36 [95% CI, 3.14-6.07]), and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 3.84 [95% CI, 2.52-5.84]) compared with persons without diabetes mellitus and no incident elevation in hs-cTnT. CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with the development of subclinical myocardial damage, as assessed by hs-cTnT, and those persons with evidence of subclinical damage were at highest risk for clinical events. These results support a possible deleterious effect of hyperglycemia on the myocardium, possibly reflecting a microvascular cause."
27311686,Shi 2016,acta diabetologica,"AIMS: To examine the association between impaired fasting glucose (IFG)/type 2 diabetes and mortality as well as to explore any interactions with dietary intake patterns in a Chinese population. METHODS: We followed 2849 Chinese adults aged 20 years and older for 10 years. Fasting plasma glucose was measured at baseline in 2002. Dietary patterns were constructed using factor analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated by Cox proportional hazards analysis (all-cause mortality) and competing risks regression [cardiovascular disease (CVD)]. RESULTS: Of the 2849 participants, 102 had diabetes and 178 had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at baseline. We documented 184 deaths (70 CVD deaths) during 27,914 person-years of follow-up. Diabetes was associated with death from all causes (HR 2.69, 95 % CI 1.62-4.49) after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Diabetes had a HR of 1.97 (95 % CI 0.84-4.60) for CVD death. IFG had 83 % increased risk of all-cause mortality. Among those with low and high intake of a vegetable-rich dietary pattern, the HR of IFG/diabetes for all-cause mortality was 3.25 (95 %CI 1.95 5.44) and 1.38 (95 % CI 0.75-2.55) (p for interaction 0.019), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and IFG are associated with a substantial increased risk of death in Chinese adults. Dietary patterns associated with a high intake of vegetable were associated with a decrease in the risk of mortality for those with IFG/diabetes."
21515847,Silbernagel 2011,diabetes care,"Objective: Glycated hemoglobin has been suggested to be superior to fasting glucose for the prediction of vascular disease and death from any cause. The aim of the present work was to analyze and compare the predictive value of glycated hemoglobin and fasting glucose on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in subjects who underwent coronary angiography. Research design and methods: We studied 2,686 participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular health study without a history of diabetes. The majority of this cohort had coronary artery disease. Glycated hemoglobin was measured at the baseline examination. The mean (± SD) duration of the follow-up for all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality was 7.54 ± 2.1 years. Results: A total of 508 deaths occurred during the follow-up. Of those, 299 were accounted for by cardiovascular diseases and 79 by cancer. Baseline glycated hemoglobin was predictive of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) for glycated hemoglobin values of <5.0, 5.0-5.4, 5.5-5.9, 6.0-6.4, 6.5-7.4, and ≥7.5% for all-cause mortality were 1.36 (0.85-2.18), 1.00 (0.76-1.32), 1.00 (reference), 1.11 (0.88-1.41), 1.39 (1.07-1.82), and 2.15 (1.32-3.53), respectively. Similar J-shaped relationships were found between glycated hemoglobin and cardiovascular and cancer mortality. The associations of glycated hemoglobin with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality remained significant after inclusion of fasting glucose as a covariate. However, fasting glucose was not significantly related to mortality when adjusting for glycated hemoglobin. Conclusions: Glycated hemoglobin significantly and independently of fasting glucose predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in whites at intermediate to high cardiovascular risk."
20697688,Skriver 2010,diabetologia,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Stepwise screening for type 2 diabetes will not only identify people with the disease or some other form of dysglycaemia (impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance), but also many individuals who are phenotypically at high risk of developing diabetes, but currently have normal glucose tolerance (NGT). We therefore sought to assess whether HbA(1c) adds prognostic information in relation to all-cause mortality in people who have NGT and a high risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: In a Danish population based stepwise screening programme for type 2 diabetes mellitus in general practice, we identified 15,634 persons at high risk of type 2 diabetes, who had NGT and a recorded HbA(1c) measurement. As comparison groups, we included 1,401 people identified as having type 2 diabetes mellitus and 8,149 individuals characterised as being at low risk of diabetes. All individuals were followed from time of screening (April 2001 to December 2006) until death or 31 October 2009. Excess mortality was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models with all-cause mortality as the outcome measure. RESULTS: Compared with individuals with NGT and HbA(1c) below 6.0%, adjusted hazard ratios were: 1.21 (95% CI 0.95 1.56) for individuals with NGT and HbA(1c) between 6.0% and 6.5%; 2.48 (95% CI 1.23-4.99) for individuals with NGT and HbA(1c) 6.5% or above (in this group there were eight deaths among 68 individuals); 1.73 (95% CI 1.40-2.13) for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HbA(1c) level in people with NGT and at high risk of diabetes was clearly associated with increased all-cause mortality."
11802755,Smith 2002,archives of internal medicine,"BACKGROUND: The contributions of fasting and 2-hour postchallenge glucose level to cardiovascular events remain ill-defined, especially for nondiabetic adults. This study examined the relative predictive power of fasting and 2-hour glucose level on cardiovascular event risk. METHODS: A total of 4014 community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who participated in the baseline visit of the Cardiovascular Health Study and who were without treated diabetes or previous myocardial infarction or stroke were eligible for analyses. Participants with treated diabetes at baseline were excluded. Incident myocardial infarction or stroke, or coronary death, was the outcome of interest. Age-, sex-, and race adjusted proportional hazards regression models described individual and joint associations between baseline measures of fasting and 2-hour postchallenge glucose level and event risk. RESULTS: There were 764 incident cardiovascular events during 8.5 years of follow-up. Fasting glucose level of 115 mg/dL (6.4 mmol/L) or more was associated with an increased cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.39-1.98]) in adjusted analyses compared with fasting glucose level less than 115 mg/dL. Two-hour glucose level was associated with a linear risk (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00-1.04] per 10 mg/dL [0.6 mmol/L]) that included an additional increase in risk for 2-hour glucose level of 154 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L) or more (HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.04-1.59]) in adjusted analyses. In joint fasting and 2-hour glucose models, only 2-hour glucose level remained predictive of event risk. CONCLUSIONS: Two-hour glucose level was better than fasting glucose level alone at identifying older adults at increased risk of major incident cardiovascular events."
30298627,Stacey 2019,journal of the american geriatrics society,"Objectives: To investigate glucose levels as a risk factor for unrecognized myocardial infarctions (UMIs). Design: Cohort SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants: Individuals aged 65 and older with fasting glucose measurements (N=4,355; normal fasting glucose (NFG), n = 2,041; impaired fasting glucose (IFG), n = 1,706; DM: n = 608; 40% male, 84% white, mean age 72.4 ± 5.6). Measurements: The relationship between glucose levels and UMI was examined. Participants with prior coronary heart disease (CHD) or UMI on initial electrocardiography were excluded. Using Minnesota codes, UMI was identified according to the presence of pathological Q-waves or minor Q-waves with ST-T abnormalities. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication use, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and smoking status. Results: Over a mean follow-up of 6 years, there were 459 incident UMIs (NFG, n=202; IFG, n=183; DM, n=74). Participants with IFG were slightly more likely than those with NFG to experience a UMI (hazard ratio (HR)=1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.91-1.36, p = .30), and those with DM were more likely than those with NFG to experience a UMI (HR=1.65, 95% CI=1.25-2.13, p < .001). After adjustment HR for UMI in IFG those with IFG were no more likely than those with NFG to experience a UMI (HR=1.01, 95% CI=0.82-1.24, p = .93), whereas those with DM were more likely than those with NFG to experience a UMI (HR=1.37, 95% CI=1.02-1.81, p = .03). The 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was not statistically significantly associated with UMI. Conclusion: Fasting glucose status, particularly in the diabetic range, forecasted UMI during 6 years of follow-up in elderly adults. Further studies are needed to clarify the level of glucose at which risk is greater. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:43-49, 2019."
1511803,Stengard 1992,diabetologia,"We studied the association of glucose intolerance with total and cause-specific mortality during a 5-year follow-up of 637 elderly Finnish men aged 65 to 84 years. Total mortality was 276 per 1000 for men aged 65 to 74 years and 537 per 1000 for men aged 75 to 84 years. Five-year total mortality adjusted for age was 364 per 1000 in diabetic men, 234 per 1000 in men with impaired glucose tolerance and 209 per 1000 in men with normal glucose tolerance. The relative risk of death among diabetic men was 2.10 (95% confidence interval 1.26 to 3.49) and among men with impaired glucose tolerance 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.94) times higher compared with men with normal glucose tolerance. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death in every glucose tolerance group. The multivariate adjusted relative risk of cardiovascular death was increased (1.55) in diabetic patients, albeit non-significantly (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 2.85). Diabetes resulted in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality among men aged 65-74 years but not among the 75- 84-year-old men. Relative risk of death from non-cardiovascular causes was slightly increased among diabetic subjects. In conclusion, diabetes mellitus is a significant determinant of mortality among elderly Finnish men."
21911559,Sui 2011,mayo clinic proceedings,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and incidence of stroke outcomes in a large cohort of asymptomatic men. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were 43,933 men (mean +/- SD age, 44.3 +/- 9.9 years) who were free of known cardiovascular disease at baseline and whose FPG levels were assessed during a preventive medical examination at the Cooper Clinic, Dallas, TX, between January 7, 1971, and March 11, 2002. Patients with diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) or low FPG (<80 mg/dL [to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555]) were excluded. Fatal stroke was identified through the National Death Index, and nonfatal stroke was ascertained from mail-back surveys. RESULTS: A total of 595 stroke events (156 fatal and 456 nonfatal strokes; 17 men reported a nonfatal stroke before they died of stroke) occurred during 702,928 person-years of exposure. Age-adjusted fatal, nonfatal, and total stroke event rates per 10,000 person-years for normal FPG (80-109 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose (110-125 mg/dL), and undiagnosed DM (>= 126 mg/dL) were 2.1, 3.4, and 4.0 (P(trend)=.002); 10.3, 11.8, and 18.0 (P(trend)=.008); and 8.2, 9.6, and 12.4 (P(trend)=.008), respectively. After further adjusting for potential confounders, the direct association between FPG and fatal, nonfatal, or total stroke events remained significant (P(trend)=.02, .03, and .01, respectively). For FPG levels of 110 mg/dL or greater, each 10-unit increment of FPG was associated with a 6% higher risk of total stroke events (P=.05). CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia (FPG, >= 110 mg/dL), even below the DM threshold (such as with impaired fasting glucose), was associated with a higher risk of fatal, nonfatal, or total stroke events in asymptomatic men."
19188510,Sung 2009,circulation,"BACKGROUND: Although diabetes is a well-known risk factor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, the cardiovascular disease risk of glycemia below the current diabetic threshold remains uncertain. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 652,901 Korean men aged 30 to 64 years from the Korean National Health Insurance System were categorized into 8 groups by fasting blood glucose (FBG) level at baseline and were followed up for cardiovascular diseases occurrence during 1992 2001. Over the follow-up period of 8.8 years, 10,954 stroke and 3766 myocardial infarction events occurred. In age-adjusted analyses, there was evidence of linear associations between FBG and myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke. However, with additional adjustment for socioeconomic position, behaviors, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, the associations with myocardial infarction and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke were markedly attenuated with increased risk only at the highest FBG levels (> or =7.5 mmol/L). With full adjustment, the association with ischemic stroke persisted; a linear increase in the risk of ischemic stroke was observed from FBG level of 5.6 mmol/L. When the analyses were repeated with those persons who had been diagnosed with diabetes removed, there was no evidence of associations of FBG with intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke, but the association with ischemic stroke persisted. CONCLUSIONS: In this Korean male population, the association with high FBG differed between ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke, and myocardial infarction. The linear increase in the risk of ischemic stroke, independently of other cardiovascular risk factors, was observed at a level below the current FBG criteria for impaired fasting glucose (> or =5.6 mmol/L). However, for other cardiovascular diseases, the current cutoff for diagnosing diabetes appropriately identified Korean men at risk."
15220254,Tai 2004,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of lowering the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) criterion for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) on the prevalence of IFG, the risks of diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with IFG. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three studies were used: 1). the 1998 National Health Survey (NHS98), a randomly selected cross-sectional sample of 4723 subjects; 2). the Singapore Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) Follow-up Study, a cohort study comprising 295 IGT and 292 normal glucose tolerance subjects (frequency matched for age, sex, and ethnic group) followed up from 1992 to 2000; and 3). the Singapore CVD Cohort Study, comprising 5920 subjects from three cross-sectional studies in whom the first ischemic heart disease (IHD) event was identified through linkage to registry databases. Risk of diabetes (Singapore IGT Follow-up study) was estimated using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity. Risk of IHD (Singapore CVD cohort) was estimated using stratified (by study, from which data were derived) Cox's proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Lowering the criterion for diagnosing IFG to 5.6 mmol/l increased the prevalence of IFG from 9.5 to 32.3% in the NHS98. The lower cutoff identified more subjects at risk of diabetes and IHD, but the relative risk was lower than that for IGT. CONCLUSIONS: Greater efforts to identify those with IGT, or a group at similar risk of diabetes and CVD, may be a more efficient public health measure than lowering the FPG criterion for diagnosing IFG."
22581733,Tamita 2012,heart,"Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that newly diagnosed glucose intolerance is common among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term clinical cardiovascular outcomes in participants with AMI with abnormal fasting glucose compared with normal fasting glucose and an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared with a normal OGTT. Methods: A prospective study was performed in 275 consecutive patients with AMI, 85 of whom had pre-diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM). Those without DM were divided into two groups based on the 75 g OGTT at the time of discharge. Abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) was defined as 2 h glucose ≥140 mg/dl; 78 patients had normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 112 had AGT. The same patients were also reclassified into the normal fasting glucose group (NFG; n=168) or the impaired fasting glucose group (IFG; n=22). The association between the glucometabolic status and long-term major adverse cardiovascular event rates was evaluated. Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the AGT group had a worse prognosis than the NGT group and an equivalent prognosis to the DM group (p<0.0005). Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that the HR of AGT to NGT for major adverse cardiovascular event rates was 2.65 (95% CI 1.37 to 5.15, p=0.004) while the HR of DM to NGT was 3.27 (1.68 to 6.38, p=0.0005). However, Cox HR of IFG to NFG for major adverse cardiovascular event rates was 1.83 (0.86 to 3.87), which was not significant. Conclusion: In patients with AMI, an abnormal OGTT is a better risk factor for future adverse cardiovascular events than impaired fasting blood glucose."
31776141,Tang 2020,diabetes care,"Objective: Diabetes in older age is heterogeneous, and the treatment approach varies by patient characteristics. We characterized the short-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk associated with hyperglycemia in older age. Research design and methods: We included 5,791 older adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who attended visit 5 (2011-2013; ages 66-90 years). We compared prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7% to <6.5%), newly diagnosed diabetes (HbA1c ≥6.5%, prior diagnosis <1 year, or taking antihyperglycemic medications <1 year), short-duration diabetes (duration ≥1 year but <10 years [median]), and long-standing diabetes (duration ≥10 years). Outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (median follow-up of 5.6 years). Results: Participants were 58% female, and 24% had prevalent cardiovascular disease. All-cause mortality rates, per 1,000 person-years, were 21.2 (95% CI 18.7, 24.1) among those without diabetes, 23.7 (95% CI 20.8, 27.1) for those with prediabetes, 33.8 (95% CI 25.2, 45.5) among those with recently diagnosed diabetes, 29.6 (95% CI 25.0, 35.1) for those with diabetes of short duration, and 48.6 (95% CI 42.4, 55.7) for those with long-standing diabetes. Cardiovascular mortality rates, per 1,000 person-years, were 5.8 (95% CI 4.6, 7.4) among those without diabetes, 6.6 (95% CI 5.2, 8.5) for those with prediabetes, 11.5 (95% CI 7.0, 19.1) among those with recently diagnosed diabetes, 8.2 (95% CI 5.9, 11.3) for those with diabetes of short duration, and 17.3 (95% CI 13.8, 21.7) for those with long-standing diabetes. After adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors, prediabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes were not significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03 [95% CI 0.85, 1.23] and HR 1.31 [95% CI 0.94, 1.82], respectively) or cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.00 [95% CI 0.70, 1.43] and HR 1.35 [95% CI 0.74, 2.49], respectively). Excess mortality risk was primarily concentrated among those with long-standing diabetes (all-cause: HR 1.71 [95% CI 1.40, 2.10]; cardiovascular: HR 1.72 [95% CI 1.18, 2.51]). Conclusions: In older adults, long-standing diabetes has a substantial and independent effect on short-term mortality. Older individuals with prediabetes remained at low mortality risk over a median 5.6 years of follow-up."
16210933,Thrainsdottir 2005,european journal of cardiovascular prevention & rehabilitation,"Background: The risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively with increasing blood glucose from levels well below the diabetic threshold. In the Reykjavík Study the relationship between heart failure and abnormal glucose regulation was already apparent at the level of impaired glucose tolerance. The aim of this study was to determine the prognosis of participants with any glucose abnormality and heart failure and to test whether the combination of these conditions may adversely affect the subsequent prognosis. Design: A prospective population-based study. Methods: Data from the first visit of 19 381 participants were used. Participants were divided into groups according to their glycaemic and heart failure level, and comparisons were made between the groups and disease-free participants serving as a reference group. The risk of mortality and morbidity was calculated with adjustments for main cardiovascular risk factors and ischaemic heart disease. Results: Participants in the reference group were younger, had lower body mass indices and more seldom a history of myocardial infarction compared with diseased groups. Mortality was lowest in the reference group (P<0.0001) increasing to a maximum in participants with the combination of glucose abnormality and heart failure. Prognostically, the mortality risk associated with abnormal glucose regulation was increased but was lower than the risk of diabetes. The risk of a new myocardial infarction was highest in participants with diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.0] or diabetes in combination with heart failure (HR 1.8; CI 1.1-2.7). Conclusions: Heart failure or glucose abnormalities are related to increased morbidity and mortality. The combination of glucose abnormality and heart failure did, however, not add further to the unfavourable prognosis in the presence of ischaemic heart disease."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective population-based cohort of 2,132 adults in Shanghai was established in 2002, and CVD information was collected during 10.9 years of follow-up. After assessing the association between BP categories and incident CVD, we analyzed the risk for CVD by blood glucose categories and BP categories combined by using multiple Cox regression analysis among 1,419 participants at follow-up. RESULTS: The corresponding incidence of CVD per 1,000 person-years for the BP <130/80 mmHg, 130-139/80-89 mmHg, and >=140/90 mmHg or treated groups were 3.0, 6.0, and 13.9, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and other factors, BP >=140/90 mmHg was significantly associated with a higher CVD risk in general (hazard ratio 2.68 [95% CI 1.36 5.25]) and in various blood glucose categories (normoglycemia 2.59, prediabetes 3.03, diabetes mellitus [DM] 4.98). However, BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg was significantly associated with a higher CVD risk in an estimated baseline 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk >=10% (3.82 [1.42-9.78]) or DM (3.54 [1.05 11.88]) but not in the general population or for a baseline 10-year ASCVD risk <10%, normoglycemia, or prediabetes. CONCLUSIONS: BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg may result in a significantly higher CVD risk in Chinese adults with an estimated 10 year ASCVD risk >=10% or DM but not in those with normoglycemia or prediabetes."
18049025,Tozawa 2007,hypertension research,"Metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Few prospective studies, however, have examined metabolic syndrome as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an Asian population. We studied the occurrence of CKD in 6,371 subjects without CKD or diabetes mellitus at baseline 1997 through 2002 in Okinawa, Japan. CKD was defined as dipstick-positive proteinuria (>or=1+) or a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the modified criteria of the Adult Treatment Panel III in which body mass index (>or=25 kg/m2) was substituted for the waist circumference measurement. Logistic analysis was used to analyze the effect of metabolic syndrome on the development of CKD. During the 5-year follow-up, 369 (5.7%) participants developed CKD. After adjusting for age, sex, current cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking habits at baseline, the relative risk of developing CKD was 1.86 (95% confidence interval: 1.43-2.41, p<0.0001) in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Compared with those without metabolic syndrome risk components, the adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) was 1.49 (1.10-2.01), 1.89 (1.38-2.59), and 2.65 (1.19-3.68) in those with 1, 2, or >or=3 metabolic syndrome risk components, respectively. Metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD in the Japanese population. Detection and treatment of metabolic syndrome should be stressed as a strategy to prevent CKD."
18757109,Tsai 2008,diabetes research and clinical practice,"The metabolic syndrome has been criticized for being ""polluted with the inclusion of frank ""diseases"" with ""pre-diseases"". We assessed the effect of a single and a combination of ""pre-disease"" risk factors of metabolic syndrome on the overall and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. These pre-disease risk factors included pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, overweight and borderline hypertriglycerdemia and were defined as: fasting glucose at 110-125 mg/dL, systolic blood pressure at 120-139 mmHg, body mass index at 25-29.9 kg/m(2) and serum triglyceride at 150-199 mg/dL, respectively. The metabolic syndrome in this paper was based on the version defined by the ATP III. The cohort consisted of 35,259 adults (>==40 years) with a medium follow-up of 15 years. Relative risks (RRs) for all-causes, CVD and ""CVD plus diabetes"" mortality were calculated with the Cox proportional hazards model. Prevalence of the pre-disease risk factors (40.2%) was nearly four times larger than the metabolic syndrome (10.6%). Individual pre-disease risk factor was associated with significant increases of 13% and 67% (pre-diabetes), 22% and 62% (pre-hypertension), 23% and 32% (overweight) and 17% and 46% (borderline hypertriglyceridemia) on all-cause and ""CVD plus diabetes"" mortality, respectively. Smoking had comparable risks as ""pre diseases"", and, as such, should also be considered as the fifth ""pre-disease"". Like metabolic syndrome, each ""Pre-disease"" is a major and significant risk factor for all cause and cardiovascular mortality, but unlike metabolic syndrome, the definition or clinical follow up of ""Pre-disease"" is simple and straightforward. Recognizing each of the four ""pre-disease"" as a clinical entity, a hitherto sub-clinical status but involving significantly increased mortality, can alert and justify early intervention through changing lifestyle and modifying biologic risk factors."
19406067,Valdes 2009,revista espanola de cardiologia,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Although type-2 diabetes is a well-known cause of death, the mortality associated with undiagnosed diabetes and early-stage dysglycemia has not been clearly determined. METHODS: This study included 1015 individuals aged 30-75 years who took part in the first phase of the Asturias study (1998-1999). Participants completed a questionnaire and underwent a physical examination and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All deaths that occurred in the cohort within 6 years of follow-up (i.e. December 1998 to December 2004) were recorded. RESULTS: Participants were divided into four groups according to the condition indicated by their OGTT result in the first phase of the study: normoglycemia, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes or diagnosed diabetes (World Health Organization 1999 criteria). A total of 42 deaths were recorded during follow-up. With normoglycemic individuals acting as a control group, multivariate analysis showed that the relative risk of mortality was 2.5 (95% CI, 1-6.3) in the group with diagnosed diabetes, 2.7 (95% CI, 1.1-6.7) in the group with undiagnosed diabetes and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.7-4) in the group with pre diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Both individuals with diagnosed diabetes and those with undiagnosed diabetes had a risk of mortality around 2.5-3 times greater than individuals with normoglycemia. Those with pre-diabetes also had increased mortality relative to the control group, though the difference was not significant."
29453200,Vistisen 2018,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: We compared the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in subgroups of prediabetes defined by fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 h plasma glucose (2hPG), or HbA1c. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Whitehall II cohort, 5,427 participants aged 50-79 years and without diabetes were followed for a median of 11.5 years. A total of 628 (11.6%) had prediabetes by the World Health Organization (WHO)/International Expert Committee (IEC) criteria (FPG 6.1 6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 6.0-6.4%), and 1,996 (36.8%) by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%). In a subset of 4,730 individuals with additional measures of 2hPG, 663 (14.0%) had prediabetes by 2hPG. Incidence rates of a major event (nonfatal/fatal CVD or all cause mortality) were compared for different definitions of prediabetes, with adjustment for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Compared with that for normoglycemia, incidence rate in the context of prediabetes was 54% higher with the WHO/IEC definition and 37% higher with the ADA definition (P < 0.001) but declining to 17% and 12% after confounder adjustment (P >= 0.111). Prediabetes by HbA1c was associated with a doubling in incidence rate for both the IEC and ADA criteria. However, upon adjustment, excess risk was reduced to 13% and 17% (P >= 0.055), respectively. Prediabetes by FPG or 2hPG was not associated with an excess risk in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes defined by HbA1c was associated with a worse prognosis than prediabetes defined by FPG or 2hPG. However, the excess risk among individuals with prediabetes is mainly explained by the clustering of other cardiometabolic risk factors associated with hyperglycemia."
16357808,Wandell 2005,diabetes & metabolism,"This study aims at estimating the association between different fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) and total mortality during a long-term follow-up. In all 2,300 subjects were health examined, out of a stratified sample of 32,185 individuals aged 18-64 years drawn from the population in Stockholm County from the years 1969-70. FBG values were divided into following groups:<3.0, 3.0-4.4, 4.5-5.5, 5.66.0, 6.1-6.6, and > 6.6 mmol/l (corresponding to fasting plasma glucose, FPG,<3.5, 3.5-4.9, 5.0-6.0, 6.1-6.9, 7.0-7.7 and > 7.7 mmol/l), and known diabetes mellitus. All participants were followed up in the National Cause of Death Register up to the end of 1996. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox regression, with three models, the first age- and sex-adjusted, the second also adjusted for care need category and hypertension, and the third with added BMI-category, with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Smoking habits were available for around half of the sample. Compared to the FBG showing the lowest mortality, i.e. FBG 5.6-6.0 mmol/l, we found an age- and sex-adjusted excess risk for subjects with known diabetes (HR 7.39, 95% CI 3.78-14.45), with FBG > 6.6 mmol/l (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.20-4.39), and with FBG<3.0 mmol/l (HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.47-8.06). The excess risk persisted when adjusting for care need, hypertension, BMI, and also for smoking. The cause of the increased mortality risk with low FBG values is unclear, but low FBG value seems to be a risk marker of poor health."
17303589,Wang 2007,european heart journal,"AIMS: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors characterized by insulin resistance. We investigated the relationship of the MetS and its single components, defined by all six different criteria, with coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality in a prospective population-based study. METHODS AND RESULTS: The MetS was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR), the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), the American College of Endocrinology (ACE), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the American Heart Association (updated NCEP) criteria. We investgated the relationship of the MetS defined by aforementioned six criteria with CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality with Cox regression analyses in a non-diabetic Finnish population of 1025 subjects, aged 65-74 years, during the 13-year follow-up. The MetS defined by all aforementioned criteria was associated with a statistically significant risk for CVD mortality when adjusted for all confounding variables (Hazards Ratios, HRs from 1.31 to 1.51). The MetS defined by the WHO, ACE, and IDF criteria was associated with an increased risk of CHD mortality (HRs from 1.42 to 1.58). There was no association between the MetS by any criteria and all-cause mortality. Of the single components of the MetS, the following predicted CVD mortality in multivariable models: impaired fasting glucose by the WHO, NCEP, and ACE criteria (HR 1.34) and by the IDF and updated NCEP criteria (HR 1.29); impaired glucose tolerance by the WHO and ACE criteria (HR 1.55); low HDL cholesterol by the EGIR criteria (HR 1.50) and by the NCEP, IDF, and updated NCEP criteria (HR 1.29); and microalbuminuria according to the WHO definition (HR 1.86). CONCLUSION: The MetS defined by all six current criteria predicts CVD mortality in elderly subjects. However, of the single components of the MetS, IFG, IGT, low HDL cholesterol, and microalbuminuria predicted CVD mortality with equal or higher HRs when compared with the different definitions of the MetS. Therefore, our study suggests that the MetS is a marker of CVD risk, but not above and beyond the risk associated with its individual components."
16720024,Wang 2007_2,atherosclerosis,"We evaluate the ability of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) defined by five definitions for predicting both incident CHD and diabetes combined, diabetes alone, and CHD alone in a Chinese population. The screening survey for type 2 diabetes was conducted in 1994. A follow-up study of 541 high-risk non-diabetic individuals who were free of CHD at baseline was carried out in 1999 in Beijing area. The MetS was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR), American College of Endocrinology (ACE), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American Heart Association (AHA) (updated NCEP) criteria. From a multiple logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, education, occupation, smoking, family history of diabetes, and total cholesterol, the relative risk of the ACE-defined MetS for incident diabetes alone (67 cases) was 2.29 (95% CI, 1.20-4.34). The MetS defined by the five definitions was associated with a 1.8-3.9 times increased risk for both incident CHD and diabetes combined (59 cases), and with a 1.9-3.0 times for total incident diabetes (126 cases). None of the five definitions predicted either incident CHD alone (177 cases) or total incident CHD (236 cases). In conclusion, the MetS defined by the current definitions appears to be more effective at predicting incident diabetes."
18323501,Wang 2008,stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited information is available on the role of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) to predict stroke. We investigated the relationship of the MetS and its single components, defined by 6 different criteria, with stroke in a prospective population-based study. METHODS: The MetS was defined according to the World Health Organization, the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), the American College of Endocrinology, the International Diabetes Federation, and the American Heart Association (updated NCEP) criteria. We investigated the relationship of the MetS with stroke using Cox regression analyses in 991 Finnish subjects without diabetes, aged 65 to 74 years at baseline, and followed-up for 14 years. RESULTS: The MetS defined by the World Health Organization, European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance, NCEP, International Diabetes Federation, and updated NCEP criteria was significantly associated with incident stroke (fatal and nonfatal) when adjusted for confounding variables (HR, 1.52 to 1.72). After exclusion of subjects with myocardial infarction, these 5 definitions still predicted stroke (HR, 1.49 to 1.80). Of the single components of the MetS, the following predicted stroke in multivariable models when subjects with myocardial infarction were excluded: impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test, 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) by the World Health Organization and American College of Endocrinology criteria (HR, 1.66); insulin resistance (HR, 1.60) by the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance criteria; and central obesity (HR, 1.52) by the NCEP criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The MetS defined by the 6 criteria except for the American College of Endocrinology definition predicts stroke in elderly subjects. However, impaired glucose tolerance alone is as strong a predictor of stroke as is the MetS defined by the World Health Organization, NCEP and updated NCEP criteria."
31365039,Wang 2019,JAMA cardiology,"Importance: Whether optimal cardiovascular health metrics may counteract the risk of cardiovascular events among patients with prediabetes or diabetes is unclear. Objective: To investigate the associations of ideal cardiovascular health metrics (ICVHMs) with subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants with prediabetes or diabetes as compared with participants with normal glucose regulation. Design, setting, and participants: The China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort Study was a nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study of 20 communities from various geographic regions in China. The study included 111 765 participants who were free from CVD or cancer at baseline. Data were analyzed between 2011 and 2016. Exposures: Prediabetes and diabetes were defined according to the American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria. Seven ICVHMs were adapted from the American Heart Association recommendations. Main outcomes and measures: The composite of incident fatal or nonfatal CVD, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalized or treated heart failure. Results: Of the 111 765 participants, 24 881 (22.3%) had normal glucose regulation, 61 024 (54.6%) had prediabetes, and 25 860 (23.1%) had diabetes. Mean (SD) age ranged from 52.9 (8.6) years to 59.4 (8.7) years. Compared with participants with normal glucose regulation, among participants with prediabetes, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for CVD was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.16-1.55) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75) for participants who had at least 5 ICVHMs; among participants with diabetes, the hazard ratios for CVD were 2.05 (95% CI, 1.76-2.38) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.56-1.15) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and at least 5 ICVHMs, respectively. Such pattern of association between ICVHMs and CVD was more prominent for participants younger than 55 years (prediabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.63; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.21; diabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.44-2.26; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.71-3.54; compared with normal glucose regulation) than for participants 65 years or older (prediabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50-1.26; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.31; diabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.46-1.35; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.22, compared with normal glucose regulation; P values for interaction ≤.02). Additionally, the hazard ratio for CVD per additional ICVHM was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.86) among participants with prediabetes and was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.89) among participants with diabetes. Conclusions and relevance: Participants with prediabetes or diabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs exhibited lower or no significant excess CVD risks compared with the participants with normal glucose regulation."
18469839,Wannamethee 2008,international journal of obesity,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the metabolic syndrome as an overall risk assessment tool for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in middle-aged British men. DESIGN: Prospective study. SUBJECTS: A total of 5128 men aged 40-59 years with no history of CVD or diabetes drawn from general practices in 24 British towns and followed up for 20 years. RESULTS: The metabolic syndrome (National Cholesterol Expert Panel definition) is associated with a significant increase in risk of total CHD (myocardial infarction, angina or CHD death) (relative risk (RR), 95% CI: 1.57, 1.39-1.97), stroke (1.61, 95% CI: 1.26-2.06) and type 2 diabetes (3.57, 95% CI: 2.83-4.50) and is a far stronger predictor of diabetes than of total CHD and stroke in middle-aged men. The metabolic syndrome was inferior to the Framingham Risk Score in predicting total CHD or major CVD over 20 years (area under the curve (AUC) 0.58 vs 0.66 for both CHD and CVD; P<0.0001 for difference) but was superior in predicting diabetes (AUC 0.70 vs 0.60; P<0.001). However, absolute risk of developing CVD or diabetes over 20 years in those with three or more abnormalities was very high, ranging from 41.8% in those with three abnormalities to over a 50% chance in those with four of five abnormalities, comparable to the absolute incidence rates in the top 2 fifths of the Framingham distribution. CONCLUSION: While the initial aim to use the metabolic syndrome to improve risk prediction of CHD has been disappointing, the syndrome identifies patients at high risk of both diabetes and CVD who may derive benefit from lifestyle intervention."
27863979,Warren 2017,lancet diabetes & endocrinology,"BACKGROUND: No consensus on definitions of prediabetes exists among international organisations. Analysis of associations with different definitions and clinical complications can inform the comparative value of different prediabetes definitions. We compared the risk of future outcomes across different prediabetes definitions based on fasting glucose concentration, HbA1c, and 2 h glucose concentration during over two decades of follow-up in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We aimed to analyse the associations of definitions with outcomes to provide a comparison of different definitions. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study of participants in the ARIC study who did not have diagnosed diabetes and who attended visit 2 (1990-92; n=10 844) and who attended visit 4 (1996-98; n=7194). ARIC participants were enrolled from four communities across the USA. Fasting glucose concentration and HbA1c were measured at visit 2 and fasting glucose concentration and 2 h glucose concentration were measured at visit 4. We compared prediabetes definitions based on fasting glucose concentration (American Diabetes Association [ADA] fasting glucose concentration cutoff 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff 6.1-6.9 mmol/L), HbA1c (ADA HbA1c cutoff 5.7-6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol] and International Expert Committee [IEC] HbA1c cutoff 6.0-6.4% [42-46 mmol/mol]), and 2 h glucose concentration (ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentration cutoff 7.8-11.0 mmol/L). FINDINGS: Prediabetes defined using the ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff (prevalence 4112 [38%] of 10 844 people; 95% CI 37.0-38.8) was the most sensitive for major clinical outcomes, whereas using the ADA HbA1c cutoff (2027 [19%] of 10 884 people; 18.0-19.4) and IEC HbA1c cutoff (970 [9%] of 10 844 people; 8.4-9.5), and the WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff (1213 [11%] of 10 844 people; 10.6-11.8) were more specific. After demographic adjustment, HbA1c-based definitions of prediabetes had higher hazard ratios and better risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality than did fasting glucose concentration-based definitions (all p<0.05). The C-statistic for incident chronic kidney disease was 0.636 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.640 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories (difference -0.005, 95% CI -0.008 to -0.001). The C-statistics were 0.662 for ADA fasting glucose clinical concentration categories and 0.672 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 0.701 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.722 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for peripheral arterial disease, and 0.683 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.688 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for all-cause mortality. Prediabetes defined using the ADA HbA1c cutoff showed a significant overall improvement in the net reclassification index for cardiovascular outcomes and death compared with prediabetes defined with glucose-based definitions. ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories, WHO fasting glucose concentration clinical categories, and ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentrations clinical categories were not significantly different in terms of risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular outcomes, or mortality outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that prediabetes definitions using HbA1c were more specific and provided modest improvements in risk discrimination for clinical complications. The definition of prediabetes using the ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff was more sensitive overall. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health."
31852727,Welsh 2020,diabetes care,"Objective: HbA1c levels are increasingly measured in screening for diabetes; we investigated whether HbA1c may simultaneously improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment, using QRISK3, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), and Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) scoring systems. Research design and methods: UK Biobank participants without baseline CVD or known diabetes ( n = 357,833) were included. Associations of HbA1c with CVD was assessed using Cox models adjusting for classical risk factors. Predictive utility was determined by the C-index and net reclassification index (NRI). A separate analysis was conducted in 16,596 participants with known baseline diabetes. Results: Incident fatal or nonfatal CVD, as defined in the QRISK3 prediction model, occurred in 12,877 participants over 8.9 years. Of participants, 3.3% ( n = 11,665) had prediabetes (42.0-47.9 mmol/mol [6.0-6.4%]) and 0.7% ( n = 2,573) had undiagnosed diabetes (≥48.0 mmol/mol [≥6.5%]). In unadjusted models, compared with the reference group (<42.0 mmol/mol [<6.0%]), those with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were at higher CVD risk: hazard ratio (HR) 1.83 (95% CI 1.69-1.97) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.96-2.60), respectively. After adjustment for classical risk factors, these attenuated to HR 1.11 (95% CI 1.03-1.20) and 1.20 (1.04-1.38), respectively. Adding HbA1c to the QRISK3 CVD risk prediction model (C-index 0.7392) yielded a small improvement in discrimination (C-index increase of 0.0004 [95% CI 0.0001-0.0007]). The NRI showed no improvement. Results were similar for models based on the ACC/AHA and SCORE risk models. Conclusions: The near twofold higher unadjusted risk for CVD in people with prediabetes is driven mainly by abnormal levels of conventional CVD risk factors. While HbA1c adds minimally to cardiovascular risk prediction, those with prediabetes should have their conventional cardiovascular risk factors appropriately measured and managed."
16249552,Wen 2005,diabetes care,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article was to assess mortality risks at different levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) in Taiwan, with particular attention to those pre-diabetic subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Governmental employees and schoolteachers were followed up for an average of 11 years. With the use of Cox regression analyses, mortality risks were calculated for 36,386 subjects, aged 40-69. RESULTS: FBG > or =110 mg/dl was associated with increased mortality risks for all causes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and diabetes. IFG, when defined as 110-125 mg/dl, was associated with a significant increase for CVD and/or diabetes mortality. These mortality risks remained elevated when known CVD risk factors were adjusted for. The IFG group shared risk factor characteristics more with the FBG > or =126 mg/dl group than with the FBG <110 mg/dl group. When IFG was defined as 100-125 mg/dl, the number of subjects quadrupled, but mortality risks diminished substantially because of the inclusion of 100-109 mg/dl group. The lowest FBG group, 50-75 mg/dl, had a significant 2-fold risk from all causes. CONCLUSIONS: There was an overall J-shaped relationship between all-cause mortality and FBG. IFG, when defined as 110-125 mg/dl, is an independent risk factor and should be aggressively treated as a disease because its subsequent mortality risks for CVD and diabetes were significantly increased. The newly defined IFG at 100-125 mg/dl did not have the predictive power for later increases in CVD or diabetes mortality."
15787678,Wild 2005,diabetic medicine,"AIMS: To compare risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality associated with different criteria for undiagnosed diabetes and glucose tolerance. METHODS: A population-based cohort of 758 men and 738 women of 55-74 years of age who had an oral glucose tolerance test or known diabetes at baseline were followed up until death or for 15 years. Mortality outcomes were compared by baseline diabetes status using people with normal glucose tolerance (i.e. those without diabetes, impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance) as the reference group. RESULTS: Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (fasting glucose of > or = 7.0 mmol/l and/or a 2-h post-challenge glucose of > or = 11.1 mmol/l) was 6.6%, of which 81% was associated with fasting glucose > or = 7.0 mmol/l and 19% was associated with isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia. Hazard ratios (95% CI) for all-cause mortality adjusted for age and sex were 1.51 (1.09-2.08) for new diabetes by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criterion (fasting glucose of > or = 7.0 mmol/l regardless of post-challenge glucose), 1.60 (1.20-2.13) for new diabetes by WHO criteria and 1.98 (1.14-3.44) for isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia. Hazard ratios (95% CI) for cardiovascular mortality adjusted for age and sex were 1.89 (1.17-3.00), 1.73 (1.12-2.66) and 1.08 (0.34-3.40) for new diabetes by ADA and WHO criteria and for isolated post-challenge hyperglycaemia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Undiagnosed diabetes was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality by any criteria but significantly increased cardiovascular disease mortality was only associated with diabetes diagnosed using the fasting glucose criterion. Mortality risks were similar in this population using either ADA or WHO criteria for diagnosis of diabetes."
21718910,Yeboah 2011,journal of the american college of cardiology,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess the cardiovascular risk of impaired fasting glucose (IFG). BACKGROUND: The associations between IFG, incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular (CV) events remains unclear. METHODS: The MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study included participants who were 45 to 84 years or age and free of clinical CV disease at baseline (2000 to 2002). Type 2 DM was defined as fasting glucose >125 mg/dl or receiving antidiabetes medication at baseline and follow-up examinations; IFG was defined as no T2DM and fasting glucose 100 to 125 mg/dl. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the association between IFG and incident DM and also between IFG and incident CV events. RESULTS: Of 6,753 participants included in these analyses, 840 (12.7%) had T2DM and 940 (13.8%) had IFG at the baseline examination. During 7.5 years of follow-up, there were 418 adjudicated CV events. Type 2 DM was associated with an increased CV incidence in the univariate model (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.25 to 3.56, p < 0.0001) and multivariate model adjusted for demographics and traditional risk factors (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.37, p < 0.0001) compared with subjects not having T2DM (IFG plus normal fasting glucose). Impaired fasting glucose was associated with increased incidence of T2DM (HR: 13.2, 95% CI: 10.8 to 16.2, p < 0.001) that remained after adjusting for demographics, highest educational level, physical activity, and body mass index (HR: 10.5, 95% CI: 8.4 to 13.1, p < 0.001) compared with normal fasting glucose. Impaired fasting glucose was associated with incident CV events in the univariate model (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.14, p < 0.001) but not in the full multivariate model (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.52, p = 0.3) compared with normal fasting glucose. CONCLUSIONS: Having IFG was not independently associated with an increased short-term risk for incident CV events. These data reiterate the importance of intervention for persons with IFG to reduce their incidence of T2DM."

The aims of this observational study were to determine the incidence of stroke and to elucidate stroke risk factors among American Indians. METHODS AND RESULTS: This report is based on 4549 participants aged 45 to 74 years at enrollment in the Strong Heart Study, the largest longitudinal, population-based study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in a diverse group of American Indians. At baseline examination in 1989 to 1992, 42 participants (age- and sex-adjusted prevalence proportion 1132/100 000, adjusted to the age and sex distribution of the US adult population in 1990) had prevalent stroke. Through December 2004, 306 (6.8%) of 4507 participants without prior stroke suffered a first stroke at a mean age of 66.5 years. The age and sex-adjusted incidence was 679/100 000 person-years. Nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction occurred in 86% of participants with incident strokes; 14% had hemorrhagic stroke. The overall age-adjusted 30-day case-fatality rate from first stroke was 18%, with a 1-year case-fatality rate of 32%. Age, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A(1c,) smoking, albuminuria, hypertension, prehypertension, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for incident stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with US white and black populations, American Indians have a higher incidence of stroke. The case-fatality rate for first stroke is also higher in American Indians than in the US white or black population in the same age range. Our findings suggest that blood pressure and glucose control and smoking avoidance may be important avenues for stroke prevention in this population."
