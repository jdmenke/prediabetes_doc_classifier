{"Abstract": ["This study aims at estimating the association between different fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) and total mortality during a long-term follow-up. In all 2,300 subjects were health examined, out of a stratified sample of 32,185 individuals aged 18-64 years drawn from the population in Stockholm County from the years 1969-70. FBG values were divided into following groups: < 3.0, 3.0-4.4, 4.5-5.5,"], "Materials and methods": ["During the years 1969-70, a stratified sample of 32,185 individuals aged 18-64 years was drawn out of the population in Stockholm County, which then had about 445,000 inhabitants in this age range. The population was stratified into three age groups, 18-24 years, 25-44 years and 45-64 years. From each of the strata a random sample was drawn, in the ratios of 3 to 2 to 1, as the primary purpose was an investigation of the need for care. The 32,185 sampled individuals received a postal questionnaire with 30 questions concerning physical and social difficulties in daily life, and health needs. The response rate was 87%. The individuals in the three age groups were classified in four different groups according to their estimated needs of services. This selection was made on the basis of the questionnaire and data obtained from registers containing information regarding hospitalisation and sick leave. Individuals with high needs were taken in a higher proportion in the subsequent randomisation procedure, as these were expected to be rather few, especially in the younger age groups. In this way a group of 3064 individuals was obtained. They were invited to the health-screening programme on average one year after the questionnaire survey and 2578 (84%) attended. 2407 individuals underwent an extensive health examination including blood test for fasting blood glucose. Data as regards blood pressure were available for 2300 of those. Thus the study group was composed of these 2300 subjects, i.e. 75% of the invited sample."], "Blood glucose values": ["Subjects were classified into different groups according to the FBG value obtained, using a lower level, the median value in the actual study sample, and cut-off values for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes according to WHO guidelines from 1999 and 1985, respectively [10][11][12]. The commonly used lower limit for the reference interval for fasting glucose values is set at FBG 3.0 mmol/l (FPG 3.5 mmol/l). The median value in the total sample was 4.5 mmol/l (FPG 5.0 mmol/l). Thus, the following groups were obtained: low FBG values, i.e. beneath 3.0 mmol/l (FPG < 3.5 mmol/l), normal FBG values beneath the median values, i.e. 3.0-4.4 mmol/l (FPG 3.5-4.9 mmol/l), normal FBG values above the median values, i.e. 4.5-5.5 mmol/l (FPG 5.0-6.0 mmol/l), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) according to WHO guidelines from 1999 [10,11], i.e. 5.6-6.0 mmol/l (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l), diabetes according to WHO guidelines from 1999 but not according to WHO guidelines from 1985 [12], i.e. 6.1-6.6 mmol/l (FPG 7.0-7.7 mmol/l), diabetes according to the WHO guidelines from 1985, i.e. above 6.6 mmol/l (FPG 7.7 mmol/l), and already known and pharmacologically treated diabetes mellitus."], "Covariates": ["Age adjustment was performed by 5-year groups. Care need group was defined as no, low or high need group, or not known, based on data on hospitalisation, sick leave and answers of questionnaire, estimating levels of expected care need. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure above 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg, or known diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Smoking habits values were available only for 47.8% (n = 1100). BMI was calculated from measured weight and height, and expressed in kg/m 2 . Overweight was defined as BMI 25-30, and obesity as above 30, according to WHO guidelines. Blood lipid values were not available."], "Follow-up": ["All participants were followed up in the National Cause of Death Register up to the end of 1996. The National Cause of Death Register contains records of all deaths among the people of Sweden and is more than 99% complete except for some emigrants. Causes of death and main diagnoses during hospitalisation were recorded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (8th and 9th revisions), based on certificates issued by physicians and coded at Statistics Sweden. The autopsy rate was about 40% during the study period."], "Statistical analysis": ["Multivariate analysis was performed, utilising a Cox regression [13]. The results are shown as hazard ratios (HR) D Diabetes Metab 2005;31:588-594 \u2022 www.masson.fr/revues/dm for the exposure variable, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the statistical analyses the individuals were categorised into 5-year intervals of age, which also takes the sampling proportions in the strata into consideration, although they are not exactly in agreement with the sampling strata [14]. As reference level regarding FBG values the interval showing the lowest total mortality was chosen, i.e. FBG 5.6-6.0 mmol/l (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l). From the death certificates the \"underlying cause of death\" was used for the calculations, and was available for all subjects in the study sample.

For subjects with FBG 6.1-6.6 mmol/l a non-significant excess risk was found. For CVD-mortality significant values was found only as regarded known diabetes.

Otherwise, it is recommended that the 2-hour glucose value at a 75-g OGTT be used rather than the FBG value for the diabetes diagnosis, as around 30% of the diabetic subjects will not be diagnosed because of normal FBG while having a diabetic 2-h glucose [21,22]. However, the test reliability is worse for OGTT than for fasting blood glucose [23]. In one large study the test-retest reproducibility was 66%, with the prevalence of diabetes decreasing from 19.3% with one OGTT to 11.3% on repeated testing of initial positive results [24].

The excess risk associated with high FBG values was seen both in the group with already known diabetes, and in the group with diabetic FBG values according to the WHO diagnostic criteria from 1985, while the excess risk was not significant those with diabetic FBG values according to the WHO diagnostic criteria from 1999 only. We also found an excess risk in subjects with low FBG values. This J-shaped relationship between glucose levels and mortality is found in earlier studies, e.g. in studies from the European DECODE Study [4,15], in a French study by Balkau et al. [3], and in an American study by Wei et al. [16]. The lowest total mortality in the DECODE study published in 2003 was found in subjects with a FPG of 4.5-5.0 mmol/l [4], in the study by Balkau et al in the interval 5.25-5.75 mmol/l [3], and in the study by Wei et al (after adjustment) in the interval 4.4-6.1 mmol [16].", "In our study, the lowest mortality was found was shown for subjects classified as IFG, i.e. FBG values 5.6-6.0 mmol/l, corresponding to FPG values 6.1-6.9 mmol/l, thus higher than in the earlier mentioned studies. We have no satisfactory explanation to this finding. The classification into IFG has been also been questioned earlier [15,17,18], and our findings seem to strengthen those concerns. Thus, an IFG diagnosis does not in itself seem to denote an increased risk, but indicates a need for further clinical investigation, i.e. repeated fasting glucose values or oral glucose tolerance test, to identify high-risk individuals. Diabetes and high fasting glucose values are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, both CVD and non-CVD. However, as regards subjects diagnosed with diabetes according to the WHO criteria from 1999, i.e. in the FBG interval 6.1-6.6 mmol/l (FPG 7.0-7.7 mmol/l), we were only able to demonstrate a moderate but non-significant excess risk in total mortality. These criteria, however, were based on the risk of eye and kidney disease, and not on risk of death [10,11].", "As regards the excess risk in low fasting glucose values, the DECODE Study Group showed an excess risk at FPG Table III Cox regression models assessing total mortality risk during 26 years of follow-up among men and women, respectively, with different levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), measured in mmol/l.

As regards gender, mortality of men was double that of women, i.e. the pattern usually found. Otherwise it is impossible to draw conclusions on gender differences of the mortality associated with the FBG-groups, due to an insufficient number of subjects in the most important groups."], "all_tables": [["Model I: Model II: Model III: Model I: Model II: Model III:", "", "<table><row><cell>Variable</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell></row><row><cell>n</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2273</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2273</cell></row><row><cell>FBG -2.9</cell><cell cols=\"6\">3.44 (1.47-8.06) 3.39 (1.44-7.99) 3.22 (1.37-7.60) 2.54 (0.56-11.56) 2.95 (0.64-13.62) 2.85 (0.62-13.20)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 3.0-4.4</cell><cell cols=\"6\">1.26 (0.82-1.92) 1.28 (0.83-1.97) 1.22 (0.79-1.88) 1.15 (0.63-2.10) 1.25 (0.67-2.33) 1.16 (0.62-2.18)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 4.5-5.5</cell><cell cols=\"6\">1.31 (0.86-1.99) 1.32 (0.86-2.02) 1.30 (0.85-1.99) 1.08 (0.59-1.96) 1.14 (0.62-2.12) 1.12 (0.60-2.09)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 5.6-6.0</cell><cell cols=\"2\">1.00 (reference) 1.00 (reference)</cell><cell>1.00 (reference)</cell><cell>1.00 (reference)</cell><cell cols=\"2\">1.00 (reference) 1.00 (reference)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 6.1-6.6</cell><cell cols=\"6\">1.45 (0.75-2.81) 1.41 (0.73-2.75) 1.37 (0.70-2.66) 1.48 (0.58-3.79) 1.52 (0.59-3.94) 1.47 (0.57-3.80)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 6.7-</cell><cell cols=\"6\">2.30 (1.20-4.39) 2.02 (1.04-3.90) 1.80 (0.92-3.52) 1.63 (0.61-4.37) 1.77 (0.64-4.84) 1.56 (0.56-4.35)</cell></row><row><cell cols=\"7\">Known diabetes 7.39 (3.78-14.45) 4.56 (2.31-9.02) 4.17 (2.10-8.27) 11.48 (4.86-27.12) 6.95 (2.85-16.94) 6.17 (2.51-15.17)</cell></row><row><cell>Hypertension</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">1.43 (1.19-1.72) 1.44 (1.19-1.75)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">2.45 (1.83-3.29) 2.45 (1.81-3.31)</cell></row><row><cell>BMI 25-30</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.87 (0.72-1.05)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>1.01 (0.76-1.36)</cell></row><row><cell>BMI &gt;30</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>1.16 (0.85-1.58)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>1.56 (0.56-4.35)</cell></row><row><cell>High care need</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">2.26 (1.83-2.80) 2.32 (1.87-2.87)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">2.16 (1.54-3.03) 2.28 (1.16-3.22)</cell></row><row><cell>Low care need</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">1.33 (1.06-1.68) 1.32 (1.05-1.67)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">1.79 (1.26-2.54) 1.80 (1.26-2.56)</cell></row><row><cell>Unknown</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">1.36 (0.92-1.99) 1.35 (0.92-1.99)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols=\"2\">1.49 (0.79-2.82) 1.50 (0.79-2.84)</cell></row><row><cell>care need</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/></row></table>"]], "all_figure_descriptions": [], "Abstract_sup": ["This study aims at estimating the association between different fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) and total mortality during a long-term follow-up.
