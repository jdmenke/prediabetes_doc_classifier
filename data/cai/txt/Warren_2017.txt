{"Abstract": ["Background No consensus on defi nitions of prediabetes exists among international organisations. Analysis of associations with diff erent defi nitions and clinical complications can inform the comparative value of diff erent prediabetes defi nitions. We compared the risk of future outcomes across diff erent prediabetes defi nitions based on fasting glucose concentration, HbA 1c , and 2 h glucose concentration during over two decades of follow-up in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We aimed to analyse the associations of defi nitions with outcomes to provide a comparison of diff erent defi nitions. MethodsWe did a prospective cohort study of participants in the ARIC study who did not have diagnosed diabetes and who attended visit 2 (1990-92; n=10 844) and who attended visit 4 (1996-98; n=7194). ARIC participants were enrolled from four communities across the USA. Fasting glucose concentration and HbA 1c were measured at visit 2 and fasting glucose concentration and 2 h glucose concentration were measured at visit 4. We compared prediabetes defi nitions based on fasting glucose concentration (American Diabetes Association [ADA] fasting glucose concentration cutoff 5\u20226-6\u20229 mmol/L and WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff 6\u20221-6\u20229 mmol/L), HbA 1c (ADA HbA 1c cutoff 5\u20227-6\u20224% [39-46 mmol/mol] and International Expert Committee [IEC] HbA 1c cutoff 6\u20220-6\u20224% [42-46 mmol/mol]), and 2 h glucose concentration (ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentration cutoff 7\u20228-11\u20220 mmol/L). Findings Prediabetes defi ned using the ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff (prevalence 4112 [38%] of 10 844 people; 95% CI 37\u20220-38\u20228) was the most sensitive for major clinical outcomes, whereas using the ADA HbA 1c cutoff (2027 [19%] of 10 884 people; 18\u20220-19\u20224) and IEC HbA 1c cutoff (970 [9%] of 10 844 people; 8\u20224-9\u20225), and the WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff (1213 [11%] of 10 844 people; 10\u20226-11\u20228) were more specifi c. After demographic adjustment, HbA 1c -based defi nitions of prediabetes had higher hazard ratios and better risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality than did fasting glucose concentration-based defi nitions (all p<0\u202205). The C-statistic for incident chronic kidney disease was 0\u2022636 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0\u2022640 for ADA HbA 1c clinical categories (diff erence -0\u2022005, 95% CI -0\u2022008 to -0\u2022001). The C-statistics were 0\u2022662 for ADA fasting glucose clinical concentration categories and 0\u2022672 for ADA HbA 1c clinical categories for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 0\u2022701 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0\u2022722 for ADA HbA 1c clinical categories for peripheral arterial disease, and 0\u2022683 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0\u2022688 for ADA HbA 1c clinical categories for all-cause mortality. Prediabetes defi ned using the ADA HbA 1c cutoff showed a signifi cant overall improvement in the net reclassifi cation index for cardiovascular outcomes and death compared with prediabetes defi ned with glucose-based defi nitions. ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories, WHO fasting glucose concentration clinical categories, and ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentrations clinical categories were not signifi cantly diff erent in terms of risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular outcomes, or mortality outcomes.Interpretation Our results suggest that prediabetes defi nitions using HbA 1c were more specifi c and provided modest improvements in risk discrimination for clinical complications. The defi nition of prediabetes using the ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff was more sensitive overall."], "Introduction": ["Prediabetes is a pressing clinical and public health problem that aff ects approximately 12-30% of US adults aged 18 years and older, depending on the defi nition used. 1 International organisations largely agree on the clinical cutoff points for diagnosis of diabetes and, in 2010, HbA 1c \u22656\u20225% (\u226548 mmol/mol) was adopted for diagnosis of diabetes by many international groups, in part based on the association of HbA 1c with retinopathy. [2][3][4][5] By contrast, the category of prediabetes does not have a uniform defi nition. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends using the following criteria to identify people with prediabetes: fasting glucose con centration between 5\u20226 and 6\u20229 mmol/L (100-125 mg/dL; impaired fasting glucose), HbA 1c of 5\u20227-6\u20224% (39-46 mmol/mol), or 2 h glucose concentration after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test of 7\u20228-11\u20220 mmol/L (140-199 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance). 6 WHO also recommends 2 h glucose of 7\u20228-11\u20220 mmol/L to identify impaired glucose tolerance, but recommends a fasting glucose concentration of 6\u20221-6\u20229 mmol/L (110-125 mg/dL) to identify impaired fasting glucose. 2 In 2009, the International Expert Committee (IEC) recommended HbA 1c of 6\u20220-6\u20224% (42-46 mmol/mol) for the identifi cation of an intermediate risk group, which has been adopted by some organisations. 5 Identifi cation of individuals with prediabetes provides an opportunity for intervention through lifestyle modifi cation and pharmacological inter ventions to prevent progression to diabetes. 6,7 Consensus on defi nitions of prediabetes could help guide resource allocation and aid public health eff orts to identify people at risk of developing diabetes and its complications.", "Although the selection of biomarker cutoff points for screening or diagnosis requires a broad range of considerations, associations with clinical outcomes are an important factor. 8 Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the prognostic performance of the abovementioned defi nitions of prediabetes in their associations with major clinical complications such as incident diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality. We compared the risk of future outcomes across diff erent defi nitions of prediabetes by fasting glucose concentration, HbA 1c , and 2 h glucose concentration during over two decades of follow-up in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study."], "Methods": [], "Study design and participants": ["This prospective cohort study was based on the ARIC study, which originally enrolled 15 792 adults aged 45-64 years from the communities of Jackson, MS; Forsyth County, NC; suburban Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD, USA. We excluded participants with prevalent diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease, those who were missing variables of interest, or those who fasted for less than 10 h (see appendix for full details). Detailed methods of the study have been previously published. 9 Briefl y, the fi rst examination, including medical, social, and demographic assessment, took place from 1987 to 1989, with three follow-up visits approximately every 3 years, and a fi fth visit between 2011 and 2013. Institutional review board approval was acquired at all study sites and written consent was obtained from all participants."], "Research in context": ["Evidence before this study We searched PubMed with the search terms \"prediabetic state\" OR \"prediabetes\", \"impaired fasting glucose\" OR \"impaired glucose tolerance\", AND \"diabetes mellitus\" OR \"diabetes\", OR \"cardiovascular diseases\" OR \"chronic renal insuffi ciency\" OR \"chronic kidney disease\", OR \"peripheral vascular diseases\" OR \"peripheral arterial disease\", OR \"all-cause mortality\" OR \"mortality\", AND \"humans\", for papers published up to June, 2015. There were no date or language restrictions. Prediabetes is characterised by elevated levels of blood glucose or hyperglycaemia that falls below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. The prognostic value of diff erent clinical defi nitions of prediabetes has not previously been formally compared. Current defi nitions include those by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which defi nes prediabetes as a fasting glucose concentration of 5\u20226-6\u20229 mmol/L, an HbA 1c of 5\u20227-6\u20224% (39-46 mmol/L), or a 2 h glucose concentration of 7\u20228-11\u20220 mmol/L. WHO recommends the same 2 h glucose concentration cutoff s as the ADA, but recommends a fasting glucose concentration of 6\u20221-6\u20229 mmol/L as another defi nition for prediabetes. The International Expert Committee (IEC) defi nes prediabetes as an HbA 1c of 6\u20220-6\u20224% (42-46 mmol/L)."], "Added value of this study": ["We compared the prognostic value of the ADA, WHO, and IEC defi nitions of prediabetes in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a large, prospective cohort study of over 10 000 middle-aged adults followed-up for over two decades for health outcomes including incident diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality. We found that WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff s and HbA 1c -based defi nitions of prediabetes result in lower prevalence estimates than ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff s and ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentration cutoff s, but were more specifi c in identifying people at risk for long-term outcomes. We also observed that ADA fasting glucose concentration and ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentration-based defi nitions of prediabetes are more sensitive for long-term outcomes. We found that HbA 1c -based defi nitions of prediabetes had stronger associations with long-term outcomes and provided modest, but statistically signifi cantly more information for risk discrimination than fasting glucose-based defi nitions for many major clinical complications. We did not observe meaningful diff erences between defi nitions using both ADA and WHO fasting glucose concentrations compared with those using ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentration cutoff s for long-term risk associations."], "Implications of all the available evidence": ["Many considerations need to be accounted for in the selection of a defi nition of prediabetes for use in population screening or other settings, but long-term risk associations can and should be taken into account when reaching consensus on a defi nition for prediabetes. "], "Articles Procedures": ["We did two main comparisons. First, with visit 2 (1990-92) as baseline, when both fasting glucose concentration and HbA 1c were measured. And, second, with visit 4 (1996-98) as baseline, when both fasting glucose concentration and 2 h glucose concentration were measured. Our fi nal sample size included 10 844 participants who attended visit 2 and 7194 participants who attended visit 4 (appendix).", "Fasting glucose was measured using a hexokinase method in serum at visit 2 and in plasma at visit 4. We formally compared and recalibrated fasting glucose concentrations to ensure equivalence of the measurements over time. 10 HbA 1c was measured in stored whole-blood samples from visit 2 by high-performance liquid chromatography using the Tosoh A 1c 2.2 Plus and Tosoh G7 methods (Tosoh Bioscience, San Francisco, CA, USA), aligned to those used in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. 11 2 h plasma glucose concentration was measured following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test administered using a hexokinase method at visit 4. 12 We defi ned prediabetes using three defi nitions recognised by the ADA: fasting glucose concentration cutoff Participants were prospectively followed up and incidents of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke), peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality were recorded until end of follow-up in 2013 (loss to follow-up was also recorded). Incident diabetes was defi ned by self-report of a physician diagnosis of diabetes or use of glucose-lowering medication reported during a study visit or annual telephone call. 13,14 Chronic kidney disease was defi ned as an estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) of <60 mL/min per 1\u202273 m\u00b2 measured at a study visit and a reduction in eGFR of at least 25% from the baseline visit to the follow-up visit, or chronic kidney disease-related hospital admission or death by continuous active surveillance, or an end-stage renal disease event identifi ed by the US Renal Data System registry. 15 Incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events were adjudicated and included any coronary heart disease hospital admission or death, or ischaemic stroke hospital admission or death, and were obtained by continuous active surveillance. Peripheral arterial disease events were identifi ed from hospital admission records (International Classifi cation of Diseases 9 discharge codes) for peripheral arterial disease (440.2, 440.3, 440.4) or leg revascularisation (38.18, 39.25, 39.29, 39.50). All-cause mortality was ascertained from hospital and National Death Index records.", "BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, lipid concentrations, and eGFR (calculated from serum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Equation) 16 were measured following standard protocols. [17][18][19] Age, sex, race centre (white, Minneapolis; black, Jackson; white, Washington County; black, Forsyth County; white, Forsyth County; as defi ned in the ARIC study design), education level, smoking status, alcohol use, parental history of diabetes, and use of lipid-lowering medications were reported at study visits. Hypertension was defi ned as an elevated systolic (\u2265140 mm Hg) or diastolic (\u226590 mm Hg) blood pressure from the mean of two measurements taken at a study visit or the use of blood-pressure-lowering medications."], "Statistical analysis": ["We compared baseline characteristics of the study participants at the relevant visit across clinical categories (normoglycaemia, prediabetes, and undiagnosed diabetes) for the diff erent defi nitions of prediabetes. We calculated sensitivity, specifi city, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of each prediabetes defi nition using 10 year Kaplan-Meier estimates comparing people with prediabetes to those with normoglycaemia against people with and without the events of interest. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of incident events associated with the diff erent clinical categories, with normoglycaemia as the reference group. Demographic-adjusted models included age, sex, and race centre. Fully adjusted models included all variables in demographic-adjusted models plus education level, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, total cholesterol concentration, HDL cholesterol concentration, triglyceride con centrations, eGFR, hypertension, smoking status, alcohol use, lipid-lowering medication use, and family history of diabetes. We used Harrell's C-statistic to compare discrimination of models with the diff erent clinical categories with respect to future outcomes and obtained 95% CIs with a jackknife approach. 20 We calculated the continuous net reclassifi cation index (cNRI) for 10 year risk of each outcome for the diff erent clinical categories, using prediabetes defi ned using ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff s as the reference. We did sensitivity analyses stratifying by race and sex and after excluding people with undiagnosed diabetes. 21 As an ancillary analysis, we replicated our study using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a nationally representative sample of the US population, to assess the generalisability of our results (appendix).

One ARIC study 22 found that fasting glucose concentration of 5\u20226-6\u20229 mmol/L and 2 h glucose of 7\u20228-11\u20220 mmol/L had similar associations with incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality during a median follow-up time of 6\u20223 years. Our results confi rm these fi ndings, but with approximately 10 more years of follow-up and more incident events. Our fi ndings are also consistent with results from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC), 23 a 73-study, participant-level meta-analysis of 294 998 individuals. The ERFC study found that, compared with fasting glucose, random glucose, or postload glucose, HbA 1c provided a small, but signifi cant, improvement in the C-statistic for discrimination of cardiovascular disease risk.", "By contrast, in the 2001 DECODE study 24 of 22 514 participants from ten diff erent European centres followed up for 8\u20228 years, 2 h glucose was more strongly associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality than was fasting glucose concentration. We do note that measurements in diff erent blood specimens (plasma, whole blood) were collected in DECODE across the ten European centres. Methodological and study population diff erences notwithstanding, the reasons why our results do not agree with the DECODE fi ndings are unclear. Meta-analyses 25,26 have also shown confl icting results for whether impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes.", "Several limitations of our study should be considered in the interpretation of our fi ndings. First, we did not have concurrent measurements of fasting glucose, HbA 1c , and 2 h glucose, and all classifi cations were based on single measurements whereas in clinical practice, these measurements might be repeated. In practice, clinical decisions are based on a compendium of laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological information. Nonetheless, for prediabetes, there are currently no formal recommendations or consensus regarding repeating tests for confi rmation. Second, as part of the ARIC study protocol, abnormal laboratory values including raised fasting glucose concentration (>11\u20221 mmol/L) or 2 h glucose (>16\u20227 mmol/L) were reported back to the participants, although less than 1\u20225% of participants had elevated values that prompted a report. HbA 1c results at visit 2 were not reported to participants as they were measured retrospectively (>10 years after sample collection). The reporting of the glucose measures to participants might have increased the probability of a diagnosis of diabetes. 27 Third, we used a defi nition of incident diabetes based on self-report. Fourth, our fi ndings might not be generalisable beyond black and white Americans. Fifth, despite the large sample size and number of events, the possibility exists that the study might have been underpowered to detect moderate diff erences between defi nitions, particularly given the overlap of defi nitions. Finally, although our results in ARIC were consistent with fi ndings for allcause and cardiovascular mortality in NHANES III, further replication, especially for other major complications in diverse populations, is needed. The strengths of this study include our ability to compare the prognostic value of multiple defi nitions of prediabetes, rigorous assessment of hyperglycaemia and related risk factors with standardised protocols and trained personnel, active surveillance for major clinical complications, and over two decades of follow-up in a large, community-based population.", "A number of considerations need to be weighed when deciding between defi nitions of prediabetes for screening programmes, and the optimal choice will depend on objectives. Long-term risk associations, along with considerations such as cost, availability, and the specifi c strengths and weaknesses of each biomarker, are all relevant. It is diffi cult to establish whether a strategy that would identify large numbers of people, including many people at low risk of future outcomes, might be more benefi cial than strategies that are highly specifi c, but might miss some high-risk individuals who should receive preventive interventions. Prediabetes defi ned by ADA and IEC HbA 1c cutoff s, and WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff s identifi ed fewer people, but these defi nitions were more specifi c for the identifi cation of people at risk for long-term outcomes. HbA 1c -based defi nitions had higher relative risk associations and showed small, but statistically signifi cant, improvements in risk discrimination for a broad range of clinical complications. Whereas prediabetes defi ned by ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff s was more sensitive, it was not as strongly associated with long-term risk of clinical complications. For long-term prediction of clinical outcomes, prediabetes defi nitions based on 2 h glucose concentration did not better predict the risk of chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular outcomes than fasting glucose concentration. The comparative usefulness of diff erent defi nitions of prediabetes will vary depending on the goals of the screening programme; however, data on long-term prognostic performance can, and should, help to inform use of and recommendations for diff erent defi nitions of prediabetes."], "Contributors": ["BW and ES designed the study and drafted the report.

Analysis of associations with different definitions and clinical complications can inform the comparative value of different prediabetes definitions. We compared the risk of future outcomes across different prediabetes definitions based on fasting glucose concentration, HbA1c, and 2 h glucose concentration during over two decades of follow-up in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We aimed to analyse the associations of definitions with outcomes to provide a comparison of different definitions. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study of participants in the ARIC study who did not have diagnosed diabetes and who attended visit 2 (1990-92; n=10 844) and who attended visit 4 (1996-98; n=7194). ARIC participants were enrolled from four communities across the USA. Fasting glucose concentration and HbA1c were measured at visit 2 and fasting glucose concentration and 2 h glucose concentration were measured at visit 4. We compared prediabetes definitions based on fasting glucose concentration (American Diabetes Association [ADA] fasting glucose concentration cutoff 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff 6.1-6.9 mmol/L), HbA1c (ADA HbA1c cutoff 5.7-6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol] and International Expert Committee [IEC] HbA1c cutoff 6.0-6.4% [42-46 mmol/mol]), and 2 h glucose concentration (ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentration cutoff 7.8-11.0 mmol/L). FINDINGS: Prediabetes defined using the ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff (prevalence 4112 [38%] of 10 844 people; 95% CI 37.0-38.8) was the most sensitive for major clinical outcomes, whereas using the ADA HbA1c cutoff (2027 [19%] of 10 884 people; 18.0-19.4) and IEC HbA1c cutoff (970 [9%] of 10 844 people; 8.4-9.5), and the WHO fasting glucose concentration cutoff (1213 [11%] of 10 844 people; 10.6-11.8) were more specific. After demographic adjustment, HbA1c-based definitions of prediabetes had higher hazard ratios and better risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality than did fasting glucose concentration-based definitions (all p<0.05). The C-statistic for incident chronic kidney disease was 0.636 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.640 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories (difference -0.005, 95% CI -0.008 to -0.001). The C-statistics were 0.662 for ADA fasting glucose clinical concentration categories and 0.672 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 0.701 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.722 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for peripheral arterial disease, and 0.683 for ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories and 0.688 for ADA HbA1c clinical categories for all-cause mortality. Prediabetes defined using the ADA HbA1c cutoff showed a significant overall improvement in the net reclassification index for cardiovascular outcomes and death compared with prediabetes defined with glucose-based definitions. ADA fasting glucose concentration clinical categories, WHO fasting glucose concentration clinical categories, and ADA and WHO 2 h glucose concentrations clinical categories were not significantly different in terms of risk discrimination for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular outcomes, or mortality outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that prediabetes definitions using HbA1c were more specific and provided modest improvements in risk discrimination for clinical complications. The definition of prediabetes using the ADA fasting glucose concentration cutoff was more sensitive overall. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health."]}
