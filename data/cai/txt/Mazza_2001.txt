Due to its high morbidity and mortality, stroke is a worldwide health care problem [2] exacting an enormous financial toll [3], as more than 50% of survivors have severe and permanent disability [4].", "Most epidemiological studies identified the key risk factors for stroke, and have provided an estimate of their relative weight in middle-aged subjects [5][6][7].", "Although the incidence of stroke rises sharply with advancing age, studies assessing the risk of stroke in the elderly are sparse, and almost limited to men [8][9][10][11][12][13]. A part from the recent data derived from the cardiovascular health study [14], the risk pattern of stroke in the elderly from the general population are therefore not well defined.", "In this paper, we identified in a cohort of elderly subjects from Northeast Italy the factors able to increase the risk of fatal stroke. This study is part of the CArdiovascular STudy in the ELderly (CASTEL), a population-based prospective study aimed at identifying cardiovascular risk factors and, more in general, the predictors of mortality in the elderly. The 14-year results are described herein."], "Materials and methods": [], "General protocol": ["The CASTEL enrolled 3282 subjects aged 65 years or above, representing 73% of elderly subjects from the Northern Italian towns of Castelfranco and Chioggia. Previous surveys [15,16] showed for this cohort a cardiovascular risk pattern comparable to that of the Italian general population [17,18]. The general characteristics of the two cohorts are summarised in No of cigarettes (daily) 6.7 -0.5 5.7 -0.4 NS data were recorded by means of Rose's questionnaire [19]. During the initial survey, trained doctors measured BP in triplicate with a sphygmomanometer at 15-min intervals, together with pulse rate. This procedure was repeated thrice at 1-month intervals. To minimise the effects of the alarm reaction, only the average of the last two measurements was taken into consideration. Subjects were considered to be sustained hypertensive when having a systolic blood pressure (BP);> 160 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP >;95 mmHg and/or a history of hypertension. Those with systolic BP values ranging between 140 and 159 mmHg and diastolic BP between 90 and 94 mmHg were labelled as borderline (BL). The difference between systolic and diastolic BP was the pulse pressure.", "At the beginning of the screening, subjects were categorised into those who had a normal glucose tolerance (blood glucose <6.10 mmol/1 without any antidiabetic treatment or any history of diabetes) and those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The latter were considered as diabetic if taking antidiabetic drugs or having a fasting blood glucose level >6.99 mmol/l in at least two separate samples, without therapy [20].", "Subjects were classified into never, current (> 1 cigarette daily) or former smokers (having given up their smoking habit for at least 1 year prior to the screening). Current smokers were subsequently segregated into quintiles based on number of cigarettes smoked daily.", "Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio between weight and squared height. 'Overweight' was defined as an index >25 kg/m2 [21]. Body surface area was calculated in m2 with the formula of Du Bois and Du Bois [22]. All subjects were screened for albuminuria with a dipstick using a random morning urine sample, as 24-hour samples are impractical for population screenings due to inconvenience and frequent collection errors [23]; urine infection was previously excluded.", "Subjects having serum uric acid (UA) levels >0.38 mmol/l (last quintile of UA) were labelled as hyperuricemic, those with serum potassium levels >5 mmol/1 (last quintile) as hyperkaliemic, and those having serum sodium levels <139mmol/1 (first quintile) as hyponatremic. Maximal expiratory flow in 1 sec (FEVI1) was measured with a dry spirometer, and reference values were individually calculated [24].", "In a randomly chosen subset of 504 subjects, left ventricular mass was calculated from the following algorithm [25]: 1.04 [(end-diastolic diameter + enddiastolic posterior wall thickness + end-diastolic septum thickness)3 -end-diastolic diameter3] -13.6. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI, in g/m2) was calculated by dividing left ventricular mass by body surface area [25]. According to Hammond [26], echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy was based on an LVMI >134 g/m2 in males and >110 g/m2 in females. [27] by an expert who did not know the aim of the study. Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation was based on the code 8-3 and that of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVHEKG) on the code 3-1 or 3-3."], "Electrocardiogram (EKG) was analysed on the basis of the Minnesota Code": ["Coronary artery disease (CAD) at entry was defined as a history of myocardial infarction and/or angina and/or electrocardiographic signs of ischaemia (Minnesota code 4-1, 4-3, 5-1 or 5-3, if codes 6-4, 7-1 and 7-2 were absent) and/or echocardiographic hypokinesia.", "Annual mortality obtained from the registrar's office was double-checked for causes of death by re- were generated with the life-table method and compared with the Mantel-Haenszel approach. Continuous variables were expressed as mean -standard deviation (SD) and divided into quintiles. For each quintile the RR (95% CI) adjusted for confounders was calculated from logistic models [28,29]."], "Results": [], "Univariate analysis": ["The mean age at entry was 73.8 ? 5. Historical stroke was reported in 126 cases (3.8%), 68 women and 58 men, respectively (insignificant difference between genders). During the follow-up period, there were 170 new cases of fatal stroke (stroke mortality rate: 5.2%, insignificant difference between genders). Cumulative curves of survival showed that stroke was the first cause of cardiovascular mortality (Figure 1)."], "Multivariate prediction of stroke mortality": ["In the whole population, 13 items (age, historical stroke and CAD, BL IGT, arterial hypertension, systolic BP, pulse pressure, atrial fibrillation, LVHEKG, UA, status of current smoker and serum potassium and sodium) turned out to be independent predictors of stroke mortality in multivariate Cox  "], "Role of cigarette smoking": ["Current smokers had a higher risk of fatal stroke (RR:", "1.60, [CI: 1.03-2.60]) than non-smokers, whereas no difference was found between former-and neversmokers (Table 2). Excess mortality was particularly high in subjects who had smoked >_40 years (7.2 vs. 1.8%, p< 0.01). No significant relationship was shown between fatal stroke and number of cigarettes smoked daily."], "Role of blood electrolytes": ["The risk of fatal stroke was significantly higher when potassium levels were > 5 mEq/ "], "Very old subjects": ["In very old subjects, only three items (age, historical stroke and LVHEKG) stroke mortality, and increased pulse pressure (> 74 mmHg) had the same meaning as hypertension."], "Discussion": ["In this study, historical stroke was the best predictor of stroke mortality. Many evidences show that survivors from an acute stroke are pre-disposed to other life-threatening diseases [30][31][32]. For example, in the Dubbo Study [33], patients with a history of stroke had a 27% risk excess of a new stroke compared to those free from prior cerebrovascular events.", "Atrial fibrillation, pulse pressure, history of CAD, LVHEKG, IGT, smoking, UA and electrolytes were other predictors. Atrial fibrillation, a common clinical problem in the elderly [34,35], notoriously predisposes stroke [34,36,37]. Approximately 17% of all autopsied elderly subjects have atrial fibrillation [37], and emboli from the heart are responsible for up to 20% of cases of stroke [38]. In the CASTEL, however, differently from Framingham [39], atrial fibrillation had no prognostic value after the age of 80 years. This could be of interest when evaluating the opportunity of treating very old subjects with warfarin.", "Hypertension is known to be a predictor of stroke [40], and practically all the studies have demonstrated a relationship between BP levels and stroke [41][42][43].", "This was confirmed in the present study, where RR of stroke mortality was 1.18, [CI: 1.02-1.63] in BL and 1.33, [CI: 1.15-1.76] in HT, as compared to normotensive (NT) subjects. The pulse component of BP was of the greatest importance even after the age of 80 years, with a progressive increase of RR with increasing pulse pressure and a sharp rise above the value of 74 mmHg. It is difficult to discuss this point, as only systolic and diastolic BP have been systematically taken into consideration in the literature [44,45], whereas pulse BP has been neglected in this respect, particularly in the elderly. High pulse pressure is known to be associated with an increase of the carotid intima-media thickness [46]; nevertheless, in the CASTEL, stroke mortality was not higher in subjects with carotid murmurs in the neck, the only index of carotid damage available on a large scale in 1983-1985. Based on the results of many previous studies [41,47], a history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris is also considered to be strongly associated with an increased risk of stroke. This was also true in the CASTEL, where subjects with a history of CAD were at an increased risk of stroke. It is therefore a good practice to make all efforts to identify and to treat subjects with CAD, with the dual aim to prevent both coronary and cerebrovascular events.", "Although not as sensitive as the echocardiogram, EKG remains an acceptable index of LVH, having a specificity around 12% [48]. In population studies, and in the CASTEL study too, LVHEKG was a predictor of stroke [49][50][51]. The simplistic conclusion that this is due to coexistent arterial hypertension must be rejected, as LVHEKG independently contributed to cerebrovascular risk.", "Diabetes mellitus, a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis [52,53], seems to have a less consistent role in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease. In fact, some studies have indicated that subjects with IGT have an increased risk of stroke [52,54,55], whereas other investigations [33,54] have denied this possibility. In the CASTEL, subjects with pre-diabetic IGT had an increased risk of stroke, independently from other cardiovascular risk factors. On the contrary, frank diabetes had no prognostic role, being probably overwhelmed, in the multivariate analysis, by other variables such as hypertension [52] and history of CAD [40]. IGT is one of the aspects of the 'X syndrome' [56], whose role in generating stroke has been clearly demonstrated [57].", "Smoking acts as a risk factor for stroke in a dosedependent manner and may also interact with hypertension, making the identification of its specific role difficult. Tobacco has short-as well as long-term effects on vessels [58] and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and its complications [59]. In the CASTEL, only current smokers experienced an increased stroke mortality. This is in agreement with the belief that a reduction of risk of stroke follows smoking cessation [60] and confirms the opportunity to promote community-based educational programs against tobacco not only among young and middleaged subjects, but also among elderly people.", "A possible prognostic role of UA has been emphasised in recent years [61,62], but its meaning as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and in particular for stroke remains uncertain. In the ARIC study [63], UA did not result to be per se a risk factor for atherosclerosis, since, when the known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases were included in multivariate analysis, UA lost any prognostic role.", "Nevertheless, in a recent study on middle-aged diabetic patients [64], hyperuricemia was a strong predictor of stroke events, independently of other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension [65,66], nephropathy [61], overweight [62] and diuretic therapy [66] (all conditions accompanied by higher UA levels). In the CASTEL, hyperuricemia (last quintile of UA) was found to be a strong and independent predictor of stroke mortality. The mechanism of this association remains unexplained, but it has been recently shown that human atherosclerotic plaque contains a considerable amount of UA [67], and hyperuricemia -via purine metabolism -may promote thrombus formation [68]. Finally, the reason why the curve of stroke mortality was patently J-shaped remains unknown, although it can be postulated that subjects with the lowest UA levels have a muscular mass below the standard and are consequently disadvantaged in survival.", "A positive relationship between dietary sodium/ potassium intake and stroke has been reported [69].", "Electrolyte disorders are common in the elderly, particularly in diabetic [70] and nephropathic [71] subjects, probably due to both hypervolaemia and renal decay. In the CASTEL, hyperkalaemia and hyponatremia were independent predictors of stroke, and the RR was particularly high (3.03, [CI: 1.67-5.46]) when the above-mentioned disorders were simultaneously present. Animal studies have shown that local cerebral ischaemia produces electrolyte disturbances via lactic acidosis [72], and a recent report in humans has also shown a significant association between cerebral injuries and hyponatremia [73]."], "Conclusions": ["The CASTEL has confirmed the important role of age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, cigarette smoking, LVH and history of stroke and CAD as risk factors for stroke, while it has failed to confirm that of gender, diabetes, serum lipids, alcohol intake, BMI and carotid murmurs. Instead, the CASTEL has identified additional risk factors such as pulse BP, IGT, UA and the blood electrolyte disorders. Finally, in our study, the risk pattern appears to be quite different in subjects who are just elderly and in those who are very old.", "Further data are needed to generate strategies for treatment and programs of public health policy related to prevention of stroke in elderly people."], "all_tables": [[], ["Table 1 .", "", "<table/>"], ["Table 1 .", "Baseline characteristics of two elderly populations of the CASTEL", "<table><row><cell>Items Chioggia (N = 1028) Castelfranco (N = 2254) p-Value between two towns</cell></row><row><cell>Age (years) 74.3 -5.3 73.5 -5.2 &lt;0.002 Males:females 426:602 855:1399 NS</cell></row><row><cell>Systolic BP (mmHg) 155.7 4 23.6 162.2 -24.7 &lt;0.0001 Diastolic BP (mmHg) 85.7 -10.8 90.3 + 12.0 &lt;0.0001</cell></row><row><cell>Heart rate (bpm) 75.7 -11.9 76.1 ? 11.2 NS</cell></row><row><cell>BMI (kg/m2) 27.3 -4.7 26.6 -4.5 NS TC (mmol/1) 5.28 -1.15 5.85 -1.12 &lt;0.0001 Triglycerides (mmol/1) 1.3 ? 0.49 1.43 -0.54 &lt;0.0001 Creatinine (jimol/1) 79.6 -35.4 79.6 -26.5 NS</cell></row><row><cell>UA (mmol/1) 0.32 + 0.09 0.31 + 0.08 NS Frank diabetes (%) 27.3 17.3 &lt;0.001</cell></row><row><cell>Hystorical CAD (%) 9.6 11.4 NS</cell></row><row><cell>Hystorical stroke (%) 4.6 8.6 &lt;0.0001</cell></row><row><cell>Smoking habits</cell></row><row><cell>Never smokers (%) 62.7 69.3</cell></row><row><cell>Former smokers (%) 19.1 17.5 &lt;0.002</cell></row><row><cell>Current smokers (%) 18.2 13.2</cell></row></table>"], ["Table 2 .", "analysis (Table2).
