{"Abstract": ["for the 4C Study Group IMPORTANCE Whether optimal cardiovascular health metrics may counteract the risk of cardiovascular events among patients with prediabetes or diabetes is unclear.OBJECTIVE To investigate the associations of ideal cardiovascular health metrics (ICVHMs) with subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants with prediabetes or diabetes as compared with participants with normal glucose regulation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThe China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort Study was a nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study of 20 communities from various geographic regions in China. The study included 111 765 participants who were free from CVD or cancer at baseline. Data were analyzed between 2011 and 2016.EXPOSURES Prediabetes and diabetes were defined according to the American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria. Seven ICVHMs were adapted from the American Heart Association recommendations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESThe composite of incident fatal or nonfatal CVD, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalized or treated heart failure. RESULTSOf the 111 765 participants, 24 881 (22.3%) had normal glucose regulation, 61 024 (54.6%) had prediabetes, and 25 860 (23.1%) had diabetes. Mean (SD) age ranged from 52.9 (8.6) years to 59.4 (8.7) years. Compared with participants with normal glucose regulation, among participants with prediabetes, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for CVD was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.16-1.55) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75) for participants who had at least 5 ICVHMs; among participants with diabetes, the hazard ratios for CVD were 2.05 (95% CI, 1.76-2.38) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.56-1.15) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and at least 5 ICVHMs, respectively. Such pattern of association between ICVHMs and CVD was more prominent for participants younger than 55 years (prediabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% CI, 0."], "Methods": [], "Study Design and Population": ["The China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort (4C) Study is a multicenter, population-based, prospective cohort study. 15 During 2011 to 2012, 193 846 men and women 40 years or older were recruited from local resident registration systems of 20 communities from various geographic regions in China to represent the general population. During 2014 to 2016, all participants were invited to attend an in-person visit, and 170 240 participants (87.8%) were followed up. At baseline and the follow-up visit, demographic characteristics, lifestyle and dietary factors, and medical history were collected by using standard questionnaires. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, oral glucose tolerance tests, and blood samples were obtained following a standard protocol. The analysis included 111 765 participants who had complete baseline information on cardiovascular health metrics and diabetes status and were free from CVD or cancer at baseline. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University. All study participants provided written informed consent."], "Data Collection": ["Data collection was performed in local community clinics by trained study personnel according to a standard protocol at baseline and the follow-up visit. A questionnaire comprising information on demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors (including cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking), family history, and medical history was administered by trained interviewers. Current alcohol drinker was defined as a person who drank alcohol regularly in the past 6 months. Education attainment was categorized as less than high school and high school or more. A food frequency questionnaire was used to collect habitual dietary intake by asking the consumption frequency and portion size of typical food items during the previous 12 months. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess physical activity. 16 Height and body weight were measured according to a standard protocol, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.", "Three blood pressure measurements were obtained from each participant by using an automated electronic device (OMRON Model HEM-752 FUZZY) in a seated position after at least a 5-minute quiet rest. Participants were required to avoid alcohol, coffee, tea, smoking, and exercise at least 30 minutes before the blood pressure measurement. The 3 readings were averaged for the analysis.", "All participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, and blood samples were collected at 0 and 2 hours during the test. Fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose concentrations were measured locally using a glucose oxidase or hexokinase method within 2 hours after blood sample collection under a stringent quality control program. Finger capillary whole-blood samples were collected by the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and were stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C and shipped to the central laboratory in the Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, which was certificated by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program and the College of American Pathologists Laboratory Accreditation Program. Glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) was measured within 4 weeks after collection by high-performance liquid chromatography using the VARIANT II Hemoglobin Testing System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The capillary HbA 1c values and the venous values from whole-blood samples collected using ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid dipotassium"], "Key Points": ["Question Are ideal cardiovascular health metrics (ICVHMs) associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease among patients with prediabetes or diabetes? Findings In this cohort study of 111 765 Chinese participants, compared with participants with normal glucose regulation, participants with prediabetes or diabetes who achieved at least 5 ICVHMs had lower or no increased risks of cardiovascular disease events compared with participants with normal glucose regulation.", "Meaning Our findings emphasize the importance of promoting the adherence to ICVHMs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease events among patients with prediabetes or diabetes. tubes were highly correlated (r = 0.99) in a validation subsample. 17 Total cholesterol was measured at the central laboratory using an autoanalyzer (ARCHITECT ci16200 analyzer; Abbott Laboratories)."], "Assessment of Prediabetes and Diabetes": ["Baseline prediabetes and diabetes were defined according to the American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria. 18 19,20 and we have validated that a BMI of at least 23 was associated with greater risks of CVD events and elevated HbA 1c than a BMI of at least 24 or at least 25 as compared with their corresponding normal BMI in this study cohort (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We used fruit and vegetable intake to evaluate a healthy diet because data on whole grain and sodium consumption were not collected, and fruits and vegetables are primary dietary components highlighted by the AHA 2020 Strategic Impact Goals and have been associated with lower risks of CVD. 21,22 We replaced fasting plasma glucose with HbA 1c as one metric to estimate glucose metabolism in participants with prediabetes or diabetes, in accordance with the stringent HbA 1c goals of the current American Diabetes Association clinical practice recommendations. 23 "], "Ascertainment of Cardiovascular Events": ["The outcome of this study was the composite of incident fatal or nonfatal CVD events including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalized or treated heart failure. Myocardial infarction was defined by characteristic changes in levels of troponin T and creatine-kinase-MB isoform, symptoms of myocardial ischemia, changes in electrocardiogram results, or a combination of them. Stroke was defined as a fixed neurologic deficit at least 24 hours because of a presumed vascular cause. Heart failure was identified by hospitalization or an emergency department visit requiring a treatment with infusion therapy for a clinical syndrome presenting with multiple signs and symptoms in consistence with cardiac decompensation or inadequate cardiac pump function. Deaths and clinical outcomes were collected from local vital registries of the National Disease Surveillance Point System and National Health Insurance System. Two members of the outcome adjudication committee independently verified each clinical event and assigned potential causes of death, and discrepancies were adjudicated by discussion involving other members of the committee. All members of the committee were unaware of the baseline risk factors of study participants."], "Statistical Analysis": ["Baseline characteristics of participants with normal glucose regulation, prediabetes, and diabetes were summarized as means with standard deviation for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. Person-time for each participant was calculated from the date of enrollment to the date of CVD diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up, whichever came first. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for CVD events, with multivariable adjustment for age, sex, education attainment, family history of diabetes, and family history of CVD. We first estimated the risk of CVD events according to individual and combined ICVHMs among participants with prediabetes or diabetes compared with participants with normal glucose regulation. In the analysis of the association between each component of the ICVHMs and CVD events, we further adjusted for all other ICVHMs. As a next analysis, we stratified participants into subgroups according to age and sex and examined the association between ICVHMs and CVD risk among participants with prediabetes or diabetes as compared with participants with normal glucose regulation in each age or sex subgroup. Among participants with prediabetes or diabetes, we also analyzed the risk of CVD events according to individual and combined ICVHMs. To test whether the pattern of association varies across stratifications, we estimated multiplicative interactions by including the product term (exposure \u00d7 stratification variable) in the models. We replicated the main analyses for nonfatal CVD events and CVD mortality in secondary analyses. All reported P values are nominal and 2-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc)."], "Results": ["Of As shown in Table 2, compared with participants with normal glucose regulation, participants with prediabetes who had 1 of these ICVHMs exhibited significantly lower risk for CVD: ideal BMI (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98), physical activity at goal (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95), healthy diet (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.95), ideal total cholesterol (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99), and ideal blood pressure (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.71). Compared with participants with normal glucose regulation, among participants with prediabetes, the HR for CVD gradu-ally decreased from 1.34 (95% CI, 1.16-1.55) in those who had 1 ICVHM or less to 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75) in those who had more than 5 ICVHMs. Participants with diabetes who had ideal blood pressure had a marginally lower risk for CVD (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71-1.18), and the risk for CVD decreased with an increasing number of ICVHMs (\u22641 ICVHM: HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.76-2.38; \u22655 ICVHMs: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.15), as compared with participants with normal glucose regulation.", "Among participants with prediabetes, the magnitude of the incremental risk for CVD associated with fewer ICVHMs was greatest among participants who were younger than 55 years (\u22655 ICVHMs: HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.63; \u22641 ICVHM: HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.21) and was lowest among participants who were 65 years or older (\u22655 ICVHMs: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50-1.26; \u22641 ICVHM: HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.31; P for interaction = .02; Figure 1A). Similar age-related interactions with the number of ICVHMs were observed among participants with diabetes compared with those with normal glucose regulation (younger than 55 years and \u22655 ICVHMs: HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.44-2.26; \u22641 ICVHM: HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.71-3.54; 65 years or older and \u22655 ICVHMs: HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.46-1.35; \u22641 ICVHM: HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.22; P for interaction <.001; Figure 1B). No statistically significant interaction was observed with sex (Figure 1C and D). Among participants with prediabetes, compared with participants who had 1 ideal metric or none, the HR for CVD was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69-0.93), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.56-0.77), 0.55 (95% CI, 0.46-0.67), and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32-0.57) for participants who had 2, 3, 4, and at least 5 ideal metrics, respectively, and was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.86) per 1-number increment in ICVHMs. A similar pattern was observed among participants with diabetes; each 1-number increment in ICVHMs was associated with an HR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.89) for CVD (Table 3). The graded association of more ICVHMs with lower risk for CVD events was consistent across normal glucose regulation, prediabetes, and diabetes strata (eTable 4 in the Supplement).", "Consistent results were observed in strata of age, sex, education attainment, family history of diabetes, family history of CVD, and diabetes duration (for participants with diabetes only) (Figure 2). We observed an interaction of each 1-number increment in ICVHMs with age on CVD events among participants with prediabetes. The HR for CVD was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96) among participants who were 65 years or older and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67-0.83) among participants who were younger than 55 years (P for interaction = .03). There were no other significant interactions. Secondary analyses showed more sig-nificant results for nonfatal CVD events but less significant results for CVD mortality (eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement)."], "Discussion": ["In this Chinese nationwide prospective cohort study of 111 765 adults, participants with prediabetes or diabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs exhibited lower or no significant excess risk of CVD events compared with those with normal glucose regulation. Compared with 1 ICVHM or none, 5 or more ideal metrics were associated with 58% and 61% lower CVD risks among participants with prediabetes and diabetes, respectively. Each additional ICVHM was associated with 18% and 15% lower risks of CVD events among participants with prediabetes and diabetes, respectively.", "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively investigate the association of ICVHMs with CVD events among individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. Randomized clinical trials evaluating cardiovascular effects of multifactorial interventions in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes are sparse and yield mixed results. [24][25][26][27][28]   (24 881 with normal glucose regulation, 61 024 with prediabetes, and 25 860 with diabetes) were included in the analysis. Hazard ratios (95% CI) were adjusted for age, sex, education attainment (less than high school or high school or greater), family history of diabetes (yes or no), and family history of CVD (yes or no). Interaction between the combination of glucose tolerance status with number of ICVHMs and age on CVD: P for interaction = .02 (A); P for interaction <.001 (B). Interaction between the combination of glucose tolerance status with number of ICVHMs and sex on CVD: P for interaction = .59 (C); P for interaction = .35 (D). with type 2 diabetes showed that intensive lifestyle intervention focused on weight loss did not reduce CVD events over a median of 9.6 years of follow-up. Prospective observational studies with regard to cardiovascular effects among patients with diabetes are limited and have mainly assessed lifestyle behaviors. [29][30][31] In this study, taking advantage of the AHA ICVHMs, we analyzed a comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor profile to ascertain its association with CVD risk. Importantly, we found that patients with prediabetes or diabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs appeared to have no significant excess or even lower risk of CVD events compared with the overall population with normal glucose regulation. In view of the rising epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes globally and in China, our findings emphasize the importance of an early intervention targeting both lifestyle behaviors and metabolic profiles among individuals with prediabetes and diabetes for the prevention of CVD. Interestingly, we detected that among younger individuals, patients with prediabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs showed lower CVD risk than individuals with normal glucose regulation, while such an association was not seen among older individuals. We speculate that the high prevalence of comorbidities and medications for chronic diseases among the elderly population may compromise the benefit of the ICVHMs. 14 However, our results did indicate that even among the elderly individuals with prediabetes or diabetes, each additional ICVHM was associated with substantially lower risk of CVD (11% to 13%), highlighting the benefit of achieving and maintaining an ideal cardiovascular health across the life course. 32 With regard to each component of cardiovascular health metrics, an ideal blood pressure was predominantly associated with lower CVD risks among individuals with prediabetes or diabetes. Surprisingly, an ideal HbA 1c level was not independently associated with the CVD risk among individuals with prediabetes. In 2018, the Whitehall II Study 10 of 5427 participants aged 50 to 79 years reported that the risk of CVD associated with prediabetes defined by HbA 1c was absolutely  "], "Strengths and Limitations": ["The strengths of this study included the large nationwide sample size, the prospective study design, the well-validated definitions of the CVD outcomes, and the comprehensive analyses including individuals with normal glucose regulation, prediabetes, or diabetes. Our study also has notable limitations. First, the relatively short follow-up duration might limit the statistical power for CVD events. Second, the cardiovascular health metrics were evaluated only at baseline, so changes in the metrics over time could not be accounted for in this study. Participants who were excluded owing to missing data on cardiovascular health metrics included a slightly higher pro-portion of men, so a selection bias may exist. The results, then, should be interpreted cautiously. Third, we evaluated an ideal diet mainly on the basis of fruit and vegetable intake, and the absence of comprehensive dietary data may underestimate the actual association of a healthy diet with CVD events. Fourth, we could not fully rule out all the residual and unmeasured confounders, such as genetic predisposition, medications, and psychological status and possible reverse causation."], "Conclusions": ["In this Chinese nationwide prospective population-based study, patients with prediabetes or diabetes who achieved a greater number of ICVHMs exhibited lower or no significant excess risks of CVD events compared with individuals with normal glucose regulation. In addition, among patients with prediabetes or diabetes, each additional ICVHM was associated with at least 15% lower risk of CVD.

Objective: To investigate the associations of ideal cardiovascular health metrics (ICVHMs) with subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants with prediabetes or diabetes as compared with participants with normal glucose regulation. Design, setting, and participants: The China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort Study was a nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study of 20 communities from various geographic regions in China. The study included 111 765 participants who were free from CVD or cancer at baseline. Data were analyzed between 2011 and 2016. Exposures: Prediabetes and diabetes were defined according to the American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria. Seven ICVHMs were adapted from the American Heart Association recommendations. Main outcomes and measures: The composite of incident fatal or nonfatal CVD, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalized or treated heart failure. Results: Of the 111 765 participants, 24 881 (22.3%) had normal glucose regulation, 61 024 (54.6%) had prediabetes, and 25 860 (23.1%) had diabetes. Mean (SD) age ranged from 52.9 (8.6) years to 59.4 (8.7) years. Compared with participants with normal glucose regulation, among participants with prediabetes, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for CVD was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.16-1.55) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75) for participants who had at least 5 ICVHMs; among participants with diabetes, the hazard ratios for CVD were 2.05 (95% CI, 1.76-2.38) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.56-1.15) for participants who had 1 ICVHM or less and at least 5 ICVHMs, respectively. Such pattern of association between ICVHMs and CVD was more prominent for participants younger than 55 years (prediabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.63; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.21; diabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.44-2.26; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.71-3.54; compared with normal glucose regulation) than for participants 65 years or older (prediabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50-1.26; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.79-1.31; diabetes and at least 5 ICVHMs: HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.46-1.35; 1 ICVHM or less: HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.22, compared with normal glucose regulation; P values for interaction \u2264.02). Additionally, the hazard ratio for CVD per additional ICVHM was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.86) among participants with prediabetes and was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.89) among participants with diabetes. Conclusions and relevance: Participants with prediabetes or diabetes who had 5 or more ICVHMs exhibited lower or no significant excess CVD risks compared with the participants with normal glucose regulation."]}
