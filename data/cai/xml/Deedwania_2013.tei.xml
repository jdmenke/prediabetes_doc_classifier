			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Whether prediabetes is an independent risk factor for incident heart failure (HF) in non-diabetic older adults remains unclear. Methods: Of the 4602 Cardiovascular Health Study participants, age ≥ 65 years, without baseline HF and diabetes, 2157 had prediabetes, defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125 mg/dL. Propensity scores for prediabetes, estimated for each of the 4602 participants, were used to assemble a cohort of 1421 pairs of individuals with and without prediabetes, balanced on 44 baseline characteristics.</p><p>Results: Participants had a mean age of 73 years, 57% were women, and 13% African American. Incident HF occurred in 18% and 20% of matched participants with and without prediabetes, respectively (hazard ratio {HR} associated with prediabetes, 0.90; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.76-1.07; p = 0.239). Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for incident HF associated with prediabetes among 4602 pre-match participants were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07-1.40; p = 0.003) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.85-1.14; p = 0.826), respectively. Among matched individuals, prediabetes had no independent association with incident acute myocardial infarction (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.81-1.28; p = 0.875), angina pectoris (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77-1.12; p = 0.451), stroke (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.70-1.06; p = 0.151) or all-cause mortality (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11; p = 0.840). Conclusions: We found no evidence that prediabetes is an independent risk factor for incident HF, other cardiovascular events or mortality in community-dwelling older adults. These findings question the wisdom of routine screening for prediabetes in older adults and targeted interventions to prevent adverse outcomes in older adults with prediabetes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Prediabetes is associated with increased risk of type II diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which in turn is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Prediabetes has also been observed to be associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events in younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, it is unknown whether prediabetes would also be associated with poor outcomes in older adults who might be exposed to multiple other competing risk factors. Further, whether the association of prediabetes with cardiovascular events is truly independent has not been examined in well-balanced propensity score-matched populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Importantly, if prediabetes indeed had an independent association with incident cardiovascular events, whether that would translate into higher mortality in older adults with prediabetes has not been previously examined. This is important as the prevalence of prediabetes increases with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Therefore, we examined the independent associations of prediabetes with incident heart failure (HF) and other cardiovascular events, and all-cause and cause-specific mortalities in propensity-matched cohorts of community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study design and participants</head><p>The CHS is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-funded longitudinal study of community-dwelling older adults to identify the presence and severity of traditional as well as new risk factors for cardiovascular disease among older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Participants aged ≥ 65 years were recruited in two phases from four communities: Forsyth County, North Carolina, Sacramento County, California, Washington County, Maryland, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. An original cohort (n = 5201) was recruited between 1989 and 1990, and a second cohort (n = 687) of African-Americans was recruited between 1992 and 1993 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>For the current analysis, we used a de-identified public-use copy of the CHS data obtained from the NHLBI, which is similar to the main CHS data, except that 93 participants did not consent to be included in that data. From the 5795 participants in the public-use copy of the data, we excluded 79 participants with missing baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) data, 930 participants with baseline diabetes, defined by the 2008 American Diabetes Association (ADA) criterion of FPG level ≥ 126 mg/dL <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or treatment with insulin or hypoglycemic drugs, and 184 participants with centrallyadjudicated baseline prevalent HF <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, resulting in a final sample size of 4602 participants for the current analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Prediabetes and other baseline measurements</head><p>Of the 4602 participants without baseline diabetes, 2157 (47%) had prediabetes based on the ADA criterion of FPG 100-125 mg/dL <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, leaving 2445 (53%) without baseline prediabetes or diabetes. Data on demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were collected at baseline and have been previously described in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Missing values were imputed using values predicted by age, sex and race.</p><p>Because only the original CHS cohort had data on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), we assembled a second cohort to estimate the association of prediabetes based on impaired OGTT. Of the 4602 CHS participants without baseline diabetes based on baseline FPG, 4151 (90%) belonged to the CHS original cohort. Of these, 425 (10%) had diabetes based on OGTT. After excluding these 425 participants with diabetes, the cohort for OGTT analysis included 3726 participants, of whom 2431 (65%) had no prediabetes or diabetes (normal OGTT), and 1295 (35%) had prediabetes (impaired OGTT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Outcome measures</head><p>The primary outcome of interest for the current analysis was incident HF during 13 years of total follow-up. The CHS Events Committee centrally adjudicated incident HF and other outcomes and the process of adjudication has been previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Briefly, self-reports of physician-diagnosed HF were obtained during semi-annual visits, which were later on verified through the review of medical records for symptoms, signs and clinical findings, use of medications commonly used for HF and follow-up surveillance assessments. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality and other incident cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. To account for the competing risk of death on incident HF, we also estimated the association of prediabetes with the composite endpoint of incident HF or all-cause mortality. All outcomes were centrally adjudicated by the CHS events committee and have been previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Assembly of a balanced study cohort</head><p>Due to significant imbalances in pre-match baseline characteristics between participants with and without prediabetes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), we used propensity score matching to assemble a cohort in which those with and without prediabetes would be well-balanced on all measured baseline covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The propensity score for prediabetes is the conditional probability of having prediabetes given a set of baseline covariates. We estimated a propensity score for prediabetes (FPG 100-125 mg/dL) for each of the 4602 participants using a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model based on the 44 baseline characteristics shown in Fig. 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Using a greedy matching protocol described elsewhere, we assembled a cohort of 1421 pairs of participants with and without prediabetes who had similar propensity scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Absolute standardized differences were estimated to quantify bias in the means of covariates across the groups and are displayed in a Love plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>]. An absolute standardized difference of 0% indicates no residual bias and we regard absolute standardized differences b10% is ignorable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistical analysis</head><p>Descriptive analyses used Pearson's Chi-square, Wilcoxon rank-sum, McNemar's and paired sample t-tests to compare those with and without prediabetes as appropriate. Kaplan Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations of prediabetes with incident HF and other outcomes in the post-match cohorts. To examine interaction with age and insulin resistance, we examined these associations by age tertile and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) median. A multivariable Cox regression model, adjusting for all covariates used in the propensity model as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) associated with prediabetes among pre-match participants. We also examined the incidence of diabetes during follow-up but before incidence of HF, and used logistic regression analysis to compare incident diabetes between those with and without prediabetes. All statistical tests were two-tailed with 95% confidence levels (CI), and SPSS for Windows (Rel. 18, 2009; Chicago: SPSS Inc.) was used for all data analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Baseline characteristics</head><p>Matched participants had a mean (±SD) age of 73 (± 6) years, 57% were women, and 13% were African Americans. Before matching, compared to the no prediabetes group, subjects with prediabetes were more likely to be male, white, had coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and had higher mean body mass index. These and all of the remaining 44 measured baseline characteristics were balanced after matching (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Post-match absolute standardized differences for all measured covariates were b10%, suggesting substantial covariate balance between the two groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Brief summary of the key findings</head><p>In community-dwelling older adults without diabetes, prediabetes was associated with higher unadjusted risk of incident HF, other cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there was no evidence that any of these associations were independent of other confounding risk factors. Although prediabetes increased the risk of incident diabetes, the absolute rate of incident diabetes was low and incident diabetes by itself was also not an independent predictor of poor cardiovascular outcomes, likely due to deaths from other competing risk factors before the development of diabetes-related complications in older adults with incident diabetes. Prediabetes is often targeted for intervention efforts for the prevention of diabetes and subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. Findings from the current study suggest that such interventions may not improve cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Potential explanations for the key findings</head><p>Observed unadjusted associations of prediabetes with incident HF and other cardiovascular events are likely attributable to confounding as these associations disappeared after these confounders were accounted for. An increased cardiovascular risk in those with prediabetes would be expected to be mediated through an increased risk of incident diabetes. However, the low incidence of diabetes and short follow-up after incident diabetes may have precluded the manifestation of adverse cardiovascular effects associated with diabetes.   This is supported by our observation that incident diabetes in general had no significant association with HF and all-cause mortality. It is also possible that new-onset diabetes in older adults is pathophysiologically different from that in younger patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The recent decrease of the FPG cutoff from 110 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL by the ADA to define impaired fasting glucose (IFG) may also help explain the observed non-significant associations between prediabetes and cardiovascular outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Another potential explanation is that older adults with incident diabetes might die from other competing risk factors before development of diabetes-related complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>

In that study, FPG ≥ 115 group also included those with untreated diabetes and incident HF was not an end point. In a study of younger (mean age, ~60 years) veterans without a history of diabetes, serum glucose was associated with incident HF <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. A meta-regression analysis of 20 prospective studies demonstrated that the risk of cardiovascular events progressively increased with increasing serum glucose levels, even among those without diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. A recent systematic review also reported an association of prediabetes with higher risk of incident cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Although that study did not report age, most of the participants were young and middle aged. For example, of the eighteen studies that used the same ADA criterion as in the current study, the two studies with the highest weights were based on men 40 to 59 years of age and men and women 30 to 89 years of age (mean, about 53 years), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, our study is distinguished by the use of FPG, exclusion of patients with prevalent HF at baseline, central adjudication of incident HF, long-term follow up, the use of propensity scores to assemble a balanced cohort, and sensitivity analysis using various definitions of prediabetes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Potential clinical and/or public health implications</head><p>Findings from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey <ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref> demonstrated that nearly 30% of Americans ≥ 20 years have prediabetes, which increases to about 50% for those ≥75 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The ADA recommends diabetes prevention for selected high-risk individuals with prediabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Because such interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes, it is tempting to conclude that they would also reduce cardiovascular events. However, a recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of prediabetes interventions (n = 23,152) has demonstrated that while there was a significant reduction in incident diabetes, there was no reduction in all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Although that study included both younger and older patients, findings from our study suggest given the lack of an independent association between prediabetes and poor outcomes in older adults, such interventions are unlikely to improve outcomes in older adults with prediabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Limitations</head><p>Our study has several limitations. Participants without prediabetes may have developed prediabetes during follow-up, thus causing regression dilution and underestimation of the true association <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. However, the higher incidence of diabetes among those with prediabetes may have cancelled that out. In addition, our sample size might be relatively small. It is possible that some individuals with elevated HbA1c but normal FPG were misclassified as prediabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, CHS only had a single baseline FPG level and did not collect data on HbA1c. In one study, HbA1c of 6.5% or higher identified  fewer individuals with diabetes than those identified by the ADA criterion of criterion of FPG level ≥ 126 mg/dL <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. We also do not have follow-up data on left ventricular ejection fraction. Naturally, our findings based on older adults may not be generalized to younger adults. However, despite suggestions of higher risk of cardiovascular events in younger and middle-age adults with prediabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, interventions do not seem to reduce all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events in these patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Conclusions</head><p>Among community-dwelling older adults, we found no evidence of an independent association of prediabetes with higher risk of incident HF, other cardiovascular events or mortality. This is in contrast to the reported association of prediabetes with higher risk of these outcomes in younger and middle-aged adults, and is likely explained in part by the fact that older adults with new-onset diabetes might die from other competing risk factors for mortality, before developing diabetes-related cardiovascular or other complications. Findings from this study should not be generalized to younger and middle-aged adults with prediabetes. Although currently there is no effective intervention to reduce all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events in those with prediabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, definite answers await future large-scale prospective randomized clinical trials. However, findings of the current study suggest that there is no evidence that targeted interventions may reduce risk of adverse cardiovascular events and death in community-dwelling older adults with prediabetes and thus, older adults should not be routinely screened for prediabetes.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
