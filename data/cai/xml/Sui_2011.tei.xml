More than 95% of them were non-Hispanic whites; they were referred by their employers or personal physicians or were self-referred.</p><p>The study was approved annually by the Cooper Institute Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent before data collection. Participants were excluded from the current study if at baseline they were either younger than 20 years or older than 90 years (n=883); they had prevalent myocardial infarction (n=394), stroke (n=70), or cancer (n=705); they were missing the measurement of FPG (n=345); or they were missing any of the covariates (n=310). We also excluded men with an FPG of less than 80 mg/dL (n=369) and those who were previously diagnosed as having DM (n=582) or reported current therapy with insulin or hypoglycemic treatment (n=274) at baseline. These selection criteria resulted in 43,933 asymptomatic men aged between 20 and 87 years, who were followed up from their baseline date until the date of stroke death (identified from the National Death Index [NDI]), the date of a reported stroke event (identified from mail-back surveys), or the end of 2004. The men in the current analyses were similar to the overall ACLS cohort (data not shown), and the death rate for the men in the current study was not materially different from the age-adjusted rates for the overall cohort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CliniCal Examination</head><p>The baseline assessment, which was performed after an overnight fast of 12 hours, included a physical examination; clinical evaluations such as blood chemistry analyses and blood pressure measurements; questionnaires on personal and family medical history, smoking and drinking habits; and an exercise test. Briefly, body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and height (kg/m 2 ), and alcohol consumption was quantified as drinks per week. One drink was standardized to 341 mL (12 oz) of beer, 142 mL (5 oz) of wine, or 43 mL (1.5 oz) of hard liquor. Resting blood pressure was measured by standard auscultatory methods after at least 5 minutes of seated rest and recorded as the average of at least 2 readings separated by 2 minutes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Hypertension was defined as systolic or diastolic blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater or a history of hypertension. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as serum total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or greater (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259). Smoking category (never, former, and current smokers), alcohol consumption (drinks/week), physical activity (sedentary or active), and family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were obtained from a standardized questionnaire. Cardiorespiratory fitness was defined as the total duration of a maximal treadmill test using a modified Balke protocol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Abnormal find-ings on electrocardiography (ECG) were largely defined as rhythm and conduction disturbances and ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities, as described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Serum samples were analyzed in a laboratory certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Lipid Standardization program. Undiagnosed type 2 DM and IFG were defined according to 1997 ADA criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> : an FPG of 126 mg/dL or greater for type 2 DM and an FPG of 110 to 125 mg/dL for IFG. In addition, FPG levels were categorized into 6 ranges, several of which may be clinically relevant (80-89, 90-99, 100-109, 110-125, 126-150, and &gt;150 mg/dL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>StrokE outComES aSCErtainmEnt</head><p>Total stroke (fatal and nonfatal stroke combined) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were fatal and nonfatal stroke events, considered separately. The NDI was the primary source for identifying stroke death. The underlying cause of death was obtained using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 430 to 434 and 436 to 438 for deaths occurring before 1999 and the Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes I60 to I69 for deaths occurring between 1999 and 2003. The accuracy of stroke mortality data from the NDI is similar to that of data from an Endpoints Review Committee that reviews both death certificates and relevant medical records to make its determination. Sesso et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> compared causes of death determined by an Endpoints Committee with those from NDI in the Physicians Health study for deaths occurring between 1982 and 1998. For NDI, the sensitivity for stroke mortality was 89%, and the specificity was 100%. However, the classification and rule changes between ICD-9 and ICD-10 have resulted in the shifting of deaths away from some underlying cause-of-death categories into others, and the number of deaths due to stroke has increased with the implementation of ICD-10. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Most of the deaths added to stroke in IDC-10 were classified as pneumonia in ICD-9.</p><p>The nonfatal stroke was confirmed from mail-back health surveys administered in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1995,  1999, and 2004. The cumulative survey response rate across all survey periods in the ACLS was approximately 70%. Nonresponse bias is a concern in epidemiological surveillance, and this issue has been investigated in the ACLS cohort. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> When data for decedents were excluded, the baseline health status and clinical measurements were similar between those who did and did not respond to the survey and those who responded early vs late to the survey. Total mortality rates were also similar between those who did and did not respond to the survey (unpublished data). These observations suggest that those who did and did not respond to the survey generally are more similar than not;</p><p>For personal use.

On these surveys, participants were asked to report whether a health care professional had ever told them that they had a stroke. If they answered yes, they were then asked to write down the diagnosis year. No information was obtained on stroke subtype. For those who reported more than 1 stroke event, the first was used for this study. In the current analysis, there were 24,037 men with at least 1 mail-back survey. Seventeen participants died of stroke after they reported a nonfatal event. In a random sample of 50 reported stroke events to which we applied a standard definition for adjudicating stroke, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> the agreement between participant medical records and reported stroke events was close to 90%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>StatiStiCal analySES</head><p>Baseline characteristics of the study population were stratified by FPG levels (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). Tests for linear trends across FPG categories were calculated using general linear models. Person-time for each participant was computed from the baseline date to the date of stroke death, the date of a reported stroke event, or the end of 2004. The mean ± SD follow-up time was 15.3±8.9 years for fatal stroke and 17.7±8.8 years for nonfatal stroke. Stroke incident rates were calculated as person-time follow-up divided by the number of cases. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios, the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and event rates (stroke outcomes per 10,000 person-years of follow-up). The proportional hazards assumption was examined and satisfied by comparing the log-log survival plots grouped on FPG categories.</p><p>Covariates included in the multivariable analyses were age, year of baseline examination, smoking habits (never, former, and current smoker), alcohol consumption (drinks per week), BMI (kg/m 2 ), total serum cholesterol level (mg/dL), hypertension, abnormal findings on ECG, family history of CVD, and survey indicator (for nonfatal and total stroke outcomes).

This is a standard approach for taking into account the differences in survey response patterns among study participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> All statistical tests were 2-sided, and P&lt;.05 was accepted to indicate statistical significance using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>A total of 595 stroke events (156 fatal and 456 nonfatal strokes; 17 patients reported a nonfatal stroke event before they died of stroke) occurred during 702,928 person-years of follow-up. At baseline, 12.8% and 2.6% of men had IFG and undiagnosed DM, respectively. Levels of FPG were directly associated with age, BMI, and other clinical risk factors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). Also, FPG levels had an inverse association with never smokers and a positive association with alcohol intake (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>); however, because of the large sample size, the clinical relevance of these results needs to be considered cautiously Age-adjusted fatal, nonfatal, and total stroke rates per 10,000 person-years across normal FPG, IFG, and undiagnosed DM were 2.1, 3.4, and 4.0 (P trend =.002); 10.3, 11.8, and 18.0 (P trend =.008); and 8.2, 9.6, and 12.4 (P trend =.008), respectively. After further adjustment for year of baseline examination, smoking, alcohol intake, total cholesterol, BMI, abnormal ECG, personal history of hypertension, family history of CVD, and survey indicator (for nonfatal and total stroke), the direct association between FPG levels and fatal, nonfatal, or total stroke remained significant (P trend =.02, .03, and .01, respectively) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Additional adjustment for physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness in the full model had little effect on the association between FPG levels and stroke risk (data not shown). Undiagnosed DM had a positive association with nonfatal and total stroke outcomes, respectively, but not a BMI = body mass index; CI = confidence interval; CVD = cardiovascular disease; DM = diabetes mellitus; ECG = electrocardiography; HR = hazard ratio; IFG = impaired fasting glucose. b SI conversion factor: To convert glucose values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555. c P value for linear trend was based on the Cox proportional hazards regression model. d Rate is expressed as per 10,000 person-years and adjusted for age. e Adjusted for age, year of examination, smoking status (never, former, and current smoker), alcohol intake (drinks/wk), and family history of CVD (present or not). f Adjusted for the above plus BMI, total serum cholesterol, abnormal ECG (present or not), and personal history of hypertension (present or not). g Adjusted for age, year of examination, smoking status (never, former, and current smoker), alcohol intake (drinks/wk), family history of CVD (present or not), and survey indicator. h Adjusted for the above plus BMI, total serum cholesterol, abnormal ECG (present or not), and personal history of hypertension (present or not).</p><p>For personal use.

The age-adjusted event rates per 10,000 person-years were almost identical between groups with FPG levels of 80 to 89 mg/dL, 90 to 99 mg/dL, and 100 to 109 mg/dL. However, beginning at FPG levels of 110 mg/dL, significantly higher fatal (P trend =.02), nonfatal (P trend =.02), and total stroke (P trend =.01) rates were observed. Further adjustment of all the potential variables did not materially change the significant associations. In addition, we calculated the age-adjusted stroke rate among a subgroup of 30,646 men with baseline information available to determine metabolic syndrome (MetS) status. We found that the age-adjusted fatal stroke mortality rate was significantly higher in men with MetS compared with those without MetS (3.6 vs 2.4 per 10,000 person-years; P=.04). However, no difference was found for the other 2 stroke outcomes (data not shown).</p><p>Because a dose-response association of FPG level to stroke outcomes appeared to begin at a level associated with IFG, we used FPG levels as a continuous variable to predict stroke in patients with FPG levels of 110 mg/dL or greater (ie, IFG and undiagnosed DM) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, each 10-unit elevation was associated with a 4% (95% CI, -7% to 17%) higher risk of fatal stroke, an 8% (95% CI, 1%-15%) high-er risk of nonfatal stroke, and a 6% (95% CI, 0%-12%) higher risk of total stroke, respectively. Age was a significant predictor of fatal, nonfatal, and total stroke. In addition, current cigarette smoking, obesity, and a history of hypertension were also significant predictors of fatal or total stroke.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The main finding of the current study is that hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of stroke events in persons without a previous diagnosis of DM. We found an initial flat association that became linear at 110 mg/dL or greater between FPG level and fatal, nonfatal, and total stroke in asymptomatic men. Multivariable models showed that IFG was strongly associated with fatal stroke and that undiagnosed DM was strongly associated with nonfatal and total stroke. Importantly, a greater risk of stroke was detected at an FPG level of 110 mg/dL, and not at 100 mg/dL, which challenges the current ADA recommendations at least in terms of stroke risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> The World Health Organization expert group <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> has not included FPG levels in the 100 to 109 mg/dL range in the definition of IFG and MetS.</p><p>Diabetes mellitus was the strongest single risk factor for stroke in a prospective study from Finland with a follow-up of 15 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Of patients with an abnormal fasting glucose FIGURE. Age-adjusted stroke event rates per 10,000 person-years according to baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level. The number of men (and cases) across the baseline FPG groups (from left to right) were as follows: fatal stroke: 6211 (18), 17,450 (37), 13,474 (43), 5641 (47), 834 (8), and 323 (3); nonfatal stroke: 3465 (46), 9473 (155), 7483 (141), 3066 (86), 408 (21), and 142 (7); and total stroke: 6211 (62), 17,448 (188), 13,473 (182), 5640 (127), 834 (27), and 323 (9). P values for linear trends were based on Cox proportional hazards regression models. level (a predictor of type 2 DM), 20% to 50% develop type 2 DM within 10 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> In our cohort of asymptomatic men, IFG was present in 12.8%, which is close to the 11% from an earlier study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Overall, we found that more than 15% of asymptomatic men had IFG or DM. Such persons should be identified as high-risk and receive primary prevention for stroke. Some, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> but not all, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12</ref> studies have reported an increased risk of stroke in those with elevated serum fasting glucose levels and in those with undiagnosed DM defined by FPG. In a study population of 13,999 patients from Israel with documented coronary heart disease, Tanne et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> reported an 84% higher risk of incident nonfatal ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with an FPG of 110 to 125 mg/dL but a nonsignificant higher risk for those with an FPG of 100 to 109 mg/dL. Recently, the DECODE study 10 a significantly increased hazard ratio for both IFG (1.18 [95% CI, 1.00-1.40]) and for screen-detected DM (1.36 [95% CI, 1.02-1.80]). However, neither that study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12</ref> nor the Euro Heart Survey on Diabetes and the Heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> showed an association between FPG levels and stroke mortality, perhaps indicating that the previous inconsistent findings between FPG levels and stroke events could be due to the different types of stroke outcomes. Therefore, to evaluate the precise role of FPG in the primary prevention of stroke, it is important to investigate various stroke outcomes in asymptomatic persons. In the current study, we found a strong association between FPG levels and stroke in men with IFG (for fatal stroke) and undiagnosed DM (for nonfatal or total stroke) after multivariable adjustment. When FPG was used as a continuous variable in the analysis, every 10-unit increment of FPG above 110 mg/dL was associated with an 8% and 6% higher risk of nonfatal and total stroke, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Some previous studies have shown that the association between FPG levels and stroke outcomes differs by sex. For example, the DECODE Study Group reported a strong positive association between FPG and stroke mortality in women but not in men. 12 However, most other studies did not separate men and women, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and therefore sex-specific studies are needed to clarify this issue. We were unable to conduct such an analysis in women because of the small number of women and stroke deaths identified from the ACLS. As the ACLS cohort expands, we are hoping to update our results, especially in women, in the near future.</p><p>One of the potential biological mechanisms is that hyperglycemia may cause early atherosclerosis in the initial phases of DM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Atherosclerotic lesions often develop at an accelerated rate in the large arteries in people with undiagnosed DM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Many factors, such as hyperglycemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction, procoagulation acceleration, fibrinolysis failure, and arterial remodeling dysfunction, may play a role in the prognosis of patients with higher levels of FPG. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Laboratory data also suggest that increased levels of blood glucose may lead to infarct expansion through several maladaptive metabolic pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> The principal strength of the current study is the large population and extensive database generated during the past 30 years. The primary limitation is the homogeneity of the cohort on socioeconomic variables: this study population comprises mainly non-Hispanic whites from middle to upper socioeconomic strata who are college graduates. However, the physiologic characteristics of our study population were similar to those of representative population groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> The homogeneity of the cohort on socioeconomic variables may reduce the possibility of confounding by education, occupation, and income. Because of their higher socioeconomic status, people in this cohort are likely to For personal use.

The expected age-adjusted stroke mortality rate in the current cohort was 37.9 per 100,000 US standard population, which was slightly lower than the 2007 age-adjusted rate for US adults (42.2 per 100,000 US standard population). <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> Another limitation of the current study is that we were unable to consider the stroke subtype. Given the size and nationwide distribution of our cohort, medical record reviewing is an ongoing process, and we have not yet completed this process on all reported cases. Therefore, we do not have sufficient information to identify ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Recent literature reported a J-shaped association between FPG levels and ischemic stroke in patients with preexisting atherothrombotic disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> More research is needed to better understand the specificity of associations between FPG levels and stroke subtypes. Regarding the exposure assessment, we only had a single measurement of FPG, which deviates from the ADA criteria for DM classification and might lead to misclassification of the exposure variable. In addition, men were classified at study enrollment, and so we were unable to assess the influence of follow-up changes in FPG levels on stroke end points. Men initially classified as having IFG could have had increases in FPG levels, developed DM, or been treated with glucose-lowing medications during the follow-up interval. Additionally, others with normal glucose levels could have transitioned to IFG, and some with IFG may have reverted to normal FPG levels. Such misclassification of exposure would likely affect the observed association in the current study. Other risk factors, such as screening guidelines, aggressiveness of DM interventions, and advanced imaging technology studies, also changed during the long period of follow-up, and the effect on results is unknown. It is also important to recognize that defining IFG by different criteria might result in other findings. Furthermore, we do not have complete data on some identified inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein) to include in the current study. Other information such as aspirin use, dietary habits, glycated hemoglobin levels, and oral glucose tolerance testing was also unavailable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Our findings suggest that higher FPG levels in people without a previous diagnosis of DM were associated with a higher risk of fatal, nonfatal, and total stroke. An FPG test is easy and inexpensive to perform and has good reproducibility and small variability in clinical practice. An early diagnosis of IFG as well as frank DM may lead to interventions, such as weight control, diet modification, and medication treatment, that optimize glycemic con-trol and reduce stroke risk in asymptomatic patients with hyperglycemia. Clinicians should also carefully assess stroke risk in patients with FPG levels between 100 and 109 mg/dL.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Proc. 2011;86(11):1042-1049 ACLS = Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study; ADA = American Diabetes Association; BMI = body mass index; CI = confidence interval; CVD = cardiovascular disease; DM = diabetes mellitus; ECG = electrocardiography; FPG = fasting plasma glucose; ICD = International Classification of Diseases; IFG = impaired fasting glucose; MetS = metabolic syndrome; NDI = National Death Index For editorial comment, see page 1038</figDesc></figure>
