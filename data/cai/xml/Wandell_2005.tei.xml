<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>iabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are both associated with increased mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality. However, the glucose thresholds used to define diabetes were chosen without regard to the risk of cardiovascular disease or mortality, but to identify people at risk of eye and kidney disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding all-term mortality and fasting glucose level, either measured as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or fasting blood glucose (FBG), earlier studies have found a J-shaped relation between the lowest death rates and FPG values in the intervals centred around 5.5 mmol/l, or around 4.75 mmol/l <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Regarding cardiovascular mortality, a study of Norwegian men found an increase only in the highest glucose quartile (FBG &gt; 85 mg/100 ml, corresponding to &gt; 4.7 mmol/l) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In contrast to that study, several other studies have found a graded and increasing relation between FPG/FBG values and cardiovascular risk factors, including cardiovascular mortality, without any sign of a clear threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. These findings are also observed for HbA 1c values <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to study the effect on total mortality in different categories of fasting blood glucose values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p>During the years 1969-70, a stratified sample of 32,185 individuals aged 18-64 years was drawn out of the population in Stockholm County, which then had about 445,000 inhabitants in this age range. The population was stratified into three age groups, 18-24 years, 25-44 years and 45-64 years. From each of the strata a random sample was drawn, in the ratios of 3 to 2 to 1, as the primary purpose was an investigation of the need for care. The 32,185 sampled individuals received a postal questionnaire with 30 questions concerning physical and social difficulties in daily life, and health needs. The response rate was 87%. The individuals in the three age groups were classified in four different groups according to their estimated needs of services. This selection was made on the basis of the questionnaire and data obtained from registers containing information regarding hospitalisation and sick leave. Individuals with high needs were taken in a higher proportion in the subsequent randomisation procedure, as these were expected to be rather few, especially in the younger age groups. In this way a group of 3064 individuals was obtained. They were invited to the health-screening programme on average one year after the questionnaire survey and 2578 (84%) attended. 2407 individuals underwent an extensive health examination including blood test for fasting blood glucose. Data as regards blood pressure were available for 2300 of those. Thus the study group was composed of these 2300 subjects, i.e. 75% of the invited sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blood glucose values</head><p>Subjects were classified into different groups according to the FBG value obtained, using a lower level, the median value in the actual study sample, and cut-off values for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes according to WHO guidelines from 1999 and 1985, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The commonly used lower limit for the reference interval for fasting glucose values is set at FBG 3.0 mmol/l (FPG 3.5 mmol/l). The median value in the total sample was 4.5 mmol/l (FPG 5.0 mmol/l). Thus, the following groups were obtained: low FBG values, i.e. beneath 3.0 mmol/l (FPG &lt; 3.5 mmol/l), normal FBG values beneath the median values, i.e. 3.0-4.4 mmol/l (FPG 3.5-4.9 mmol/l), normal FBG values above the median values, i.e. 4.5-5.5 mmol/l (FPG 5.0-6.0 mmol/l), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) according to WHO guidelines from 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, i.e. 5.6-6.0 mmol/l (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l), diabetes according to WHO guidelines from 1999 but not according to WHO guidelines from 1985 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, i.e. 6.1-6.6 mmol/l (FPG 7.0-7.7 mmol/l), diabetes according to the WHO guidelines from 1985, i.e. above 6.6 mmol/l (FPG 7.7 mmol/l), and already known and pharmacologically treated diabetes mellitus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariates</head><p>Age adjustment was performed by 5-year groups. Care need group was defined as no, low or high need group, or not known, based on data on hospitalisation, sick leave and answers of questionnaire, estimating levels of expected care need. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure above 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg, or known diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Smoking habits values were available only for 47.8% (n = 1100). BMI was calculated from measured weight and height, and expressed in kg/m 2 . Overweight was defined as BMI 25-30, and obesity as above 30, according to WHO guidelines. Blood lipid values were not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up</head><p>All participants were followed up in the National Cause of Death Register up to the end of 1996. The National Cause of Death Register contains records of all deaths among the people of Sweden and is more than 99% complete except for some emigrants. Causes of death and main diagnoses during hospitalisation were recorded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (8th and 9th revisions), based on certificates issued by physicians and coded at Statistics Sweden. The autopsy rate was about 40% during the study period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Multivariate analysis was performed, utilising a Cox regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The results are shown as hazard ratios (HR) D Diabetes Metab 2005;31:588-594 • www.masson.fr/revues/dm for the exposure variable, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the statistical analyses the individuals were categorised into 5-year intervals of age, which also takes the sampling proportions in the strata into consideration, although they are not exactly in agreement with the sampling strata <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. As reference level regarding FBG values the interval showing the lowest total mortality was chosen, i.e. FBG 5.6-6.0 mmol/l (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l). From the death certificates the "underlying cause of death" was used for the calculations, and was available for all subjects in the study sample. The analyses were performed by the PHREG procedure in the SAS data package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table I</head><p>Descriptive data of the study sample (n = 2300), by sex, and with number of deaths, are shown. FBG are fasting blood glucose levels, measured in mmol/l, hypertension is known hypertension or measured high blood pressure (systolic &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 90 mmHg), BMI is category of body mass index in kg/m 2 , care need category is according to predicted care needs. Percentage is given as regards distribution for men and women, respectively.  <ref type="table">II</ref> for total and CVD-mortality, respectively. Three models are shown, Model 1 age-and sex-adjusted, Model II also including adjustment for hypertension and care need category, and Model III also with addition of BMI-category. Consistent, significant findings in the models as regards total mortality were the excess risk for subjects with known diabetes, with FBG over 6.7 mmol/l (however, not when adjusting for BMI-category) and FBG beneath 3.0 mmol/l. For subjects with FBG 6.1-6.6 mmol/l a non-significant excess risk was found. For CVD-mortality significant values was found only as regarded known diabetes. Excess risk for total and CVD-mortality was found for men, subjects with hypertension, and for subjects in the high care need group, and to some extent also for those in the low care group. Analyses for cancer death were also performed, showing figures essentially of the same levels as for total and CVD-mortality, however, not statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Men</head><p>When using a model including smoking habits (n = 1078) in addition to all others factors, the excess risk for all-cause mortality remained relatively stable for subjects with FBG beneath 3.0 mmol/l (HR 3.18, 95% CI 0.86-11.70), for those with FBG over 6.7 mmol/l (HR 1.81, 95% CI 0.63-5.20) and those with known diabetes (HR 8.17, 95% CI 2.93-22.75), while the risk decreased for subjects with FBG 6.1-6.6 mmol/l (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.20-2.63), and it did not change any more for cardiovascular mortality. Test for interaction between smoking and FBG-levels for both total and CVD-mortality showed no statistical significance. The hazard ratio for smokers in the multivariate model was 1.79 (95% CI 1.36-2.36) for total mortality, and 1.72 (95% CI 1.12-2.64) for CVD-mortality.</p><p>Models for men and women separately are shown in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. Significant excess mortality risk was present for known diabetes for both men and women, and for low FBG only for women. For women, the lowest mortality was found for FBG 6.1-6.6 mmol/l.</p></div>

Reference groups were as regards sex women, as regards hypertension normotensive subjects, as regards BMI-level those with BMI &lt; 25, and as regards care need level those with no care needs. When excluding deaths occurring during the first five years of follow-up, the excess risk of total mortality, when adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, care need level and BMI-category, for low FBG values persisted (HR 3.38, 95% CI 1.42-8.02), while the risk further decreased for FBG &gt; 6.6 mmol/l (HR 1.39, 95% CI 0.66-2.93).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The main finding was a J-curved risk of long-term mortality in relation to FBG values. The excess risk associated with high FBG values was seen both in the group with already known diabetes, and in the group with diabetic FBG values according to the WHO diagnostic criteria from 1985, while the excess risk was not significant those with diabetic FBG values according to the WHO diagnostic criteria from 1999 only. We also found an excess risk in subjects with low FBG values. This J-shaped relationship between glucose levels and mortality is found in earlier studies, e.g. in studies from the European DECODE Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, in a French study by Balkau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and in an American study by Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The lowest total mortality in the DECODE study published in 2003 was found in subjects with a FPG of 4.5-5.0 mmol/l <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, in the study by Balkau et al in the interval 5.25-5.75 mmol/l <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and in the study by Wei et al (after adjustment) in the interval 4.4-6.1 mmol <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In our study, the lowest mortality was found was shown for subjects classified as IFG, i.e. FBG values 5.6-6.0 mmol/l, corresponding to FPG values 6.1-6.9 mmol/l, thus higher than in the earlier mentioned studies. We have no satisfactory explanation to this finding. The classification into IFG has been also been questioned earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, and our findings seem to strengthen those concerns. Thus, an IFG diagnosis does not in itself seem to denote an increased risk, but indicates a need for further clinical investigation, i.e. repeated fasting glucose values or oral glucose tolerance test, to identify high-risk individuals. Diabetes and high fasting glucose values are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, both CVD and non-CVD. However, as regards subjects diagnosed with diabetes according to the WHO criteria from 1999, i.e. in the FBG interval 6.1-6.6 mmol/l (FPG 7.0-7.7 mmol/l), we were only able to demonstrate a moderate but non-significant excess risk in total mortality. These criteria, however, were based on the risk of eye and kidney disease, and not on risk of death <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>As regards the excess risk in low fasting glucose values, the DECODE Study Group showed an excess risk at FPG Table <ref type="table">III</ref> Cox regression models assessing total mortality risk during 26 years of follow-up among men and women, respectively, with different levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), measured in mmol/l. Three models are presented, Model I with adjustment for age and sex, and Model II also including adjustment for category of care need and hypertension, and Model III also addition of BMI-categories (BMI-values were missing for a few persons). Reference groups were: as regards hypertension, normotensive subjects; as regards BMI-level, those with BMI &lt; 25, and as regards care need level, those with no care need. As regards gender, mortality of men was double that of women, i.e. the pattern usually found. Otherwise it is impossible to draw conclusions on gender differences of the mortality associated with the FBG-groups, due to an insufficient number of subjects in the most important groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Men</head><p>The influence of the covariates is also of interest. The group with highest care need also showed the highest mortality risk, which is natural and merely an evidence of the accuracy of this categorization. As diabetic subjects are expected to have high care needs, this would explain the decreased mortality risk found among those subjects when adjusting for care need. As regards hypertension, the increased total and especially CVD-mortality is also natural. The increased mortality associated with smoking is also well known. However, smoking is also shown to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, even if the most important predictive factor for smoking-associated mortality is the substantially increased risk of CVD, respiratory diseases and cancers. On the other hand obesity was found to show a rather low predictive effect.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study. Some important risk factors especially for cardiovascular disease and death were not available for all subjects, e.g. smoking habits was noticed for around half of the sample, and blood lipid values were not measured. The number of subjects in some of the groups, i.e. with FBG values beneath 3.0 mmol/l and above 6.0 mmol/l, including the subjects with known diabetes, was too small to allow secure evaluations. Thus, the analyses in further sub-groups, e.g., into men and women, and regarding CVD-and cancer-mortality, should be interpreted with caution, as the numbers were too low to yield enough statistical power. However, the general tendencies could be seen in these sub-groups as well, even if no conclusions could be drawn between differences between men and women, or between total, CVD and cancer-mortality.</p><p>Glucose values were measured on one single occasion, and no oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. Otherwise, it is recommended that the 2-hour glucose value at a 75-g OGTT be used rather than the FBG value for the diabetes diagnosis, as around 30% of the diabetic subjects will not be diagnosed because of normal FBG while having a diabetic 2-h glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. However, the test reliability is worse for OGTT than for fasting blood glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In one large study the test-retest reproducibility was 66%, with the prevalence of diabetes decreasing from 19.3% with one OGTT to 11.3% on repeated testing of initial positive results <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Thus, using FBG value for diabetes diagnosis can be justified.</p><p>The strengths of the study are the high attendance rate and the long follow-up time, 26 years, and high quality of data from the National Cause of Death Register.</p><p>In conclusion, a J-shaped curve was found for all-cause mortality regarding FBG levels, with highest mortality among subjects with known diabetes at baseline, and also an excess mortality for subjects with FBG of 6.7 mmol/l (FPG 7.8 mmol/l) and above, and FBG below 3.0 mmol/l (FPG 3.5 mmol/l). The cause of the increased mortality risk for low FBG values is unclear, however low FBG values must be seen as a risk marker of poor health.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Model I: Model II: Model III: Model I: Model II: Model III:</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table><row><cell>Variable</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell><cell>Hazard Ratio</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell><cell>(95%CI)</cell></row><row><cell>n</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2273</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2300</cell><cell>2273</cell></row><row><cell>FBG -2.9</cell><cell cols="6">3.44 (1.47-8.06) 3.39 (1.44-7.99) 3.22 (1.37-7.60) 2.54 (0.56-11.56) 2.95 (0.64-13.62) 2.85 (0.62-13.20)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 3.0-4.4</cell><cell cols="6">1.26 (0.82-1.92) 1.28 (0.83-1.97) 1.22 (0.79-1.88) 1.15 (0.63-2.10) 1.25 (0.67-2.33) 1.16 (0.62-2.18)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 4.5-5.5</cell><cell cols="6">1.31 (0.86-1.99) 1.32 (0.86-2.02) 1.30 (0.85-1.99) 1.08 (0.59-1.96) 1.14 (0.62-2.12) 1.12 (0.60-2.09)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 5.6-6.0</cell><cell cols="2">1.00 (reference) 1.00 (reference)</cell><cell>1.00 (reference)</cell><cell>1.00 (reference)</cell><cell cols="2">1.00 (reference) 1.00 (reference)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 6.1-6.6</cell><cell cols="6">1.45 (0.75-2.81) 1.41 (0.73-2.75) 1.37 (0.70-2.66) 1.48 (0.58-3.79) 1.52 (0.59-3.94) 1.47 (0.57-3.80)</cell></row><row><cell>FBG 6.7-</cell><cell cols="6">2.30 (1.20-4.39) 2.02 (1.04-3.90) 1.80 (0.92-3.52) 1.63 (0.61-4.37) 1.77 (0.64-4.84) 1.56 (0.56-4.35)</cell></row><row><cell cols="7">Known diabetes 7.39 (3.78-14.45) 4.56 (2.31-9.02) 4.17 (2.10-8.27) 11.48 (4.86-27.12) 6.95 (2.85-16.94) 6.17 (2.51-15.17)</cell></row><row><cell>Hypertension</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">1.43 (1.19-1.72) 1.44 (1.19-1.75)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">2.45 (1.83-3.29) 2.45 (1.81-3.31)</cell></row><row><cell>BMI 25-30</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.87 (0.72-1.05)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>1.01 (0.76-1.36)</cell></row><row><cell>BMI &gt;30</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>1.16 (0.85-1.58)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>1.56 (0.56-4.35)</cell></row><row><cell>High care need</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">2.26 (1.83-2.80) 2.32 (1.87-2.87)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">2.16 (1.54-3.03) 2.28 (1.16-3.22)</cell></row><row><cell>Low care need</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">1.33 (1.06-1.68) 1.32 (1.05-1.67)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">1.79 (1.26-2.54) 1.80 (1.26-2.56)</cell></row><row><cell>Unknown</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">1.36 (0.92-1.99) 1.35 (0.92-1.99)</cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">1.49 (0.79-2.82) 1.50 (0.79-2.84)</cell></row><row><cell>care need</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note>Male 2.01 (1.69-2.40) 2.05 (1.72-2.45) 2.07 (1.73-2.45) 2.27 (1.73-2.98) 2.44 (1.86-3.21) 2.44 (1.84-3.22) Diabetes Metab 2005;31:588-594 • www.masson.fr/revues/dm</note></figure>
