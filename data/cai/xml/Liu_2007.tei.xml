After adjusting for nonmetabolic risk factors, HRs of total CVD, CHD, and ischemic stroke in MetS were significant and higher than those in non-MetS, regardless of glycemic status. In the absence of MetS, the impact of dysglycemia was found only in IFG to CHD and diabetes to ischemic stroke.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has fallen in many countries, but it has been rising in China in recent decades, accompanying the rapid change in lifestyle, such as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Cardiovascular disease is now the leading cause of death in China, accounting for N40% in total mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Wellestablished risk factors for CVD are smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and dysglycemia. An important condition underlying the latter 3 is obesity, which is becoming increasingly common in China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The cluster-ing of these risk factors has been called the metabolic syndrome (MetS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Because impaired glucose regulation closely interplays with other components of MetS, and elevated glucose per se is considered as one of the components in the clinical definition of MetS, to date, the CVD risk associated with MetS versus elevated glucose independent of each other has not been fully defined. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Several studies have demonstrated that people with MetS had an increase in CVD prevalence, incidence, or mortality even without diabetes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> On the other hand, the isolated effect of diabetes on CVD is less studied. Alexander et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> reported that in the NHANES III, people with diabetes without MetS did not have an increase in coronary heart disease (CHD) prevalence; nevertheless, the follow-up study of NHANES II showed diabetes independent of MetS carries an increased risk for CHD and CVD mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> To compare and contrast the CVD risk associated with the MetS and impaired glucose regulation independent of each other, we evaluated the 10-year incidence risk of different types of CVD (including CHD, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke) in relation to MetS and dysglycemia (impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and diabetes) in the Chinese Multi-provincial Cohort Study (CMCS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p>The CMCS was a nationwide, multicenter, prospective cohort study on CVD. As previously reported, 9,10 a total of 30 378 subjects 35 to 64 years of age and free of CVD were included with the informed consent. Ninety percent of the participants (n = 27 249) were recruited from the baseline survey in 1992, carried out in 16 centers from 11 provinces of China. In addition, 3129 subjects from Beijing were added in 1996 to 1999. The response rate was 82.1% and 75.0% for the 2 surveys, respectively. Both surveys followed the protocol in the WHO-MONICA Project. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> A face-to-face follow-up for new CHD and stroke events was carried out at the end of each year for the 1992 cohort from 1992 to 1995, and the follow-up rate was 94%. From 1996, 6 centers ceased following up because of the completion of that national research project. The remainder 16 811 subjects in 10 centers of the 1992 to 1993 cohort and the 3129 subjects of the 1996 to 1999 cohort were continuously followed up till the end of 2003, and the follow-up rate was 86%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ascertainment of CHD and stroke</head><p>Coronary and stroke events were ascertained according to the WHO-MONICA protocol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Coronary events include acute myocardial infarction, sudden death, and other coronary deaths. The events were diagnosed based on symptoms, development in ECG (Minnesota codes for up to 4 records), serum enzymes, and autopsy findings. Stroke events included patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, or cerebral infarction, which were defined as rapidly developing signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting N24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death) with no apparent nonvascular cause. Detailed procedure of case registration and quality control has been published elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> Definition of diabetes, IFG, and the MetS Diabetes was diagnosed if fasting blood glucose z126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) at the baseline examination as defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> or with a previous clinical diagnosis. Impaired fasting glucose was defined when fasting glucose ranged from 100 to 125 mg/dL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> The MetS was defined according to the updated criteria from the Third Adult Treatment Panel Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> which requires the presence of z3 of the following: elevated triglyceride (TG) level z150 mg/dL, reduced highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men b40 and women b50 mg/dL), elevated fasting glucose z100 mg/dL or previously diagnosed diabetes, elevated blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP z130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP z85 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medication), or large waist circumference for Asians (z90 cm in men and z80 cm in women). Evidence to support these waist thresholds to define abdominal obesity for the Chinese population has been recently reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>The prevalence rates of risk factors were adjusted for age and sex and stratified by glycemic status and presence or absence of the MetS. Incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of events occurred by person-years of follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to assess the hazard ratios of CVD incidence in relation to diabetes, IFG, and the MetS and adjusted for age, sex, smoking, CVD family history, and elevated total cholesterol. The interaction with sex was tested at a probability of .05, and no statistical significant interaction was found. SPSS software (Version 13; SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>This study revealed the interrelations of MetS and dysglycemia in the middle-aged Chinese population. Among the subjects, 18.2% were defined as having MetS, 21.1% had IFG, and 6.8% had diabetes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The prevalence of MetS in IFG and diabetes was 38.1% and 48.7%, 4.0 and 5.1 times of that in subjects with normal fasting glucose (NFG), respectively. Sixty-two percent of the subjects with MetS had IFG or diabetes, which was 3.1 times of that prevalent in non-MetS. After adjustment for age and sex, the risk factor levels were higher in subjects with the MetS regardless of glucose levels, except for smoking (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>). Another potentially important finding was a strikingly higher prevalence of elevated non-HDL-C in persons with MetS.  As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>, IFG or diabetes were associated with higher incidence risk of CHD, ischemic stroke, and total CVD but not hemorrhagic stroke, compared with NFG. Subjects with MetS had higher risk of CHD, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and total CVD than those without MetS. The impact of MetS on CVD was further assessed according to the number of components and different combinations of the components. The latter was undertaken for total CVD only because the number of cases was limited for separate analysis of CHD and stroke. Cardiovascular disease risk increased in proportion to the number MetS components (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>), and there was a wide variation depending on profile of concomitant disorders. If only 1 component was present, elevated BP was the only significant predictor of CVD. The impact of hyperglycemia was slight and nonsignificant if no other components were coexisted. When 2 components were present, 6 of the 10 combinations were associated with significantly higher risk. However, all combinations of z3 components (MetS) had significant contribution, except for those rare phenotypes (b1% of the whole sample) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>).</p><p>To compare MetS with prediabetes and diabetes, the CVD risk was presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> according to presence or absence of MetS and glycemic status after adjusting nonmetabolic risk factors. In the absence of MetS, IFG and diabetes carried a mild and lower risk of developing CHD than MetS without IFG or diabetes, and the risk associated with IFG was higher than that for diabetes. When all forms of dysglycemia combined, hyperglycemia without MetS was associated with a mild and nonsignificant increased risk for CHD (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.98-1.95), whereas MetS carried a significant risk of CHD even in the absence of hyperglycemia (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.21-2.86), compared with subjects without either MetS or hyperglycemia.</p><p>Subjects with MetS had a higher incidence risk of ischemic stroke regardless of the level of dysglycemia Waist, waist circumference z90 cm in men and z80 cm in women; TG, z150 mg/dL; BP, systolic BP z130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP z 85 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medication; GLU, z100 mg/dL or previously diagnosed diabetes; HDL-C, b40 mg/dL in men and b50 mg/dL in women.</p><p>(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Nonetheless, even in the absence of MetS, diabetes was accompanied by a higher incidence of ischemic stroke, compared with those with either NFG or IFG. This was true even if those with isolated hyperglycemia did not have higher prevalence of elevated BP than those without hyperglycemia (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>). Once MetS was present, the incidence of ischemic stroke rose markedly. Of interest, neither IFG nor diabetes was accompanied by an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Individuals with MetS had a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke than did those without MetS (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>). The significance of impact of MetS on hemorrhagic stroke, however, was lost for dysglycemic subjects when the data were controlled for non-MetS risk factors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The MetS consists of a clustering of metabolic risk factors and is associated with increased risk for CVD. One of the features of MetS is impaired glucose regulation. Several reports further indicate that dysglycemia, regardless of its severity, is accompanied by increased risk for CVD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> To date, the relative contributions of MetS and dysglycemia on CVD risk have not been dissected. For example, Alexander et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> indicated that most of the risk for CHD associated with diabetes in the US population, which is predominantly white, can be explained by the coexistence of the MetS. Howard et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> reported that the elevated CHD risk in diabetes largely depends on concomitant risk factors in American Indians. In contrast, Stern et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> reported that, in patients with existing CVD from the San Antonio Heart Study, which is predominantly Hispanic, most of CVD mortality occurs in persons with diabetes, whereas MetS independent of diabetes has little impact on mortality. To our knowledge, whether MetS carries any additional CVD risk after excluding both prediabetes and diabetes and whether hyperglycemia in prediabetes or diabetes carries any additional CVD risk independent of other metabolic disorders are yet to be defined. The current study was carried out in an effort to dissect the relative contributions of MetS and dysglycemia (including prediabetes and diabetes) to several forms of CVD in the Chinese population.</p><p>The overlap between MetS and dysglycemia in the Chinese population was marked. Sixty-two percent of persons with MetS had either IFG or diabetes. This overlap most likely can be attributed to a high prevalence of abdominal obesity in persons with MetS. Hazard ratio and 95% CI for cardiovascular diseases associated with the MetS and dysglycemia after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, family history of CVD, and hypercholesterolemia by Cox proportional hazards model. X axis: 1/NFG without MetS (reference), 2/IFG without MetS; 3/diabetes without MetS, 4/NFG with MetS, 5/IFG with MetS; 6/diabetes with MetS.</p><p>In addition, dysglycemia is one of the components of the MetS diagnosis, which added to the overlap. But an important question is whether the increased CVD risk that is associated with MetS and with dysglycemia can be explained by dysglycemia per se or whether the greater risk can be attributed to a clustering of metabolic risk factors.</p><p>Our study showed that in the Chinese population, the risk of developing CVD events in individuals with IFG or diabetes without MetS was mild and lower than the risk in those with MetS without IFG or diabetes. Isolated hyperglycemic did not manifest a significantly higher risk of developing CVD, unless other metabolic disorders were coexisted. These findings strongly suggest that the risk of CVD seen in those with IFG or diabetes was largely attributable to the accompanying multiple metabolic abnormalities rather than hyperglycemia per se. Our data are consistent with the findings from clinical trails, which indicated multifactorial intervention rather than only intensive glycemic control is better in reducing CVD risk in patients with diabetes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> These results point to need to identify the clustering of metabolic aberrations accompanying the MetS. Detecting only diabetes or prediabetes is not sufficient to identify persons at higher risk for CVD because of metabolic disorders. Actually, about 40% of people with MetS did not manifest hyperglycemia. However, this group classified more people with obesity and other metabolic abnormalities, and their CVD risk had already increased significantly. Similarly, most patients with dyslipidemia (65.6% for high TG and 69.1% for low HDL-C) did not present hyperglycemia: they were either isolated dyslipidemia or clustered with obesity or hypertension. The high prevalence of isolated high TG or low HDL-C may partly be due to the high consumption of dietary carbohydrates in Chinese population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Therefore, when data were split by the status of MetS, hyperglycemia was not associated with a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia.</p><p>Among the metabolic risk factors, hypertension has been reported to be the foremost contributor to risk for CVD in China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> In the present study, elevated BP was the only component of MetS, which carried significant CVD risk in absence of other disorders. A higher prevalence of hypertension was particularly evident in subjects with the MetS. This higher BP thus appears to be a prominent component of the MetS in China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Although there is much focus on the MetS as a prediabetic condition and on concern about its association with a rising prevalence of diabetes in China, the importance of elevated BP as a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with the MetS and diabetes should not be overlooked. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Identification and early intervention of MetS is helpful to control hypertension and associated cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Another feature of the MetS in China was a much higher non-HDL-C level. It can be explained by elevated concentrations of both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterolmarkers for atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> An elevation of the latter lipoproteins must be recognized as an integral part of MetS in China and a significant contributor to CHD and stroke. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> Since most persons with MetS had dysglycemia, we can return to the question of whether most of the CVD risk associated with the MetS can be explained by an increase in plasma glucose levels. The data are consistent with some contribution of dysglycemia to CVD risk but, certainly, not all. Subjects with MetS and diabetes had higher rates of both CHD and ischemic stroke than did MetS subjects without diabetes. This suggests that the hyperglycemia of diabetes carries independent risk. The relatively low CHD risk associated with diabetes in the absence of MetS might be due to the limited cases in this group, given the fact that few people had diabetes but without MetS.</p><p>The contribution of different MetS traits to the incidence of CVD was also considered in the present study. Our results are concordant with the findings from the Framingham Heart Study 29 that the associated CVD risk for various number and combinations of MetS components was heterogeneous. Unlike their analysis which used the group without a specific combination as the comparator, we used the group without any component as the reference to explore the bnetQ effect of a specific trait. In the present study, all those with z3 components had significantly higher CVD risk, except for the rare combinations. Our data corroborate the rationale of defining the cluster of z3 disorders as MetS. Nevertheless, the specific contribution of various MetS traits to CHD and stroke needs to be investigated in future studies with more events.</p><p>This study provides strong evidence that the multiple metabolic risk factors accompanying MetS is a major cause of both CHD and stroke in China. Although there is a large overlap between MetS and dysglycemia in China, the association between MetS and CVD cannot be explained entirely by dysglycemia. Both hypertension and dyslipidemia, which are common in persons with the MetS, likely play an equal or greater role in the causation of CVD.
